CAPE TOWN - With no word yet about when flights operating under Comair will resume, many passengers have been left frustrated. This comes after Comair failed to convince the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that it had fixed safety concerns uncovered by the regulator after an investigation into a string of mishaps. It resulted in many locals left scrambling to make alternative arrangements. Plumstead resident Daphne Jubber and her husband were meant to fly to Australia to visit loved ones on Friday.

Now, Jubber said they were considering alternative arrangements in order to make their international flight. “We need to get on that Emirates flight at 3pm on Friday. Now I am wondering if I should book another airline.” For Durbanville resident Jeanette Holmes, it was a bit trickier. Holmes and her husband were meant to fly to Durban on a Kulula flight on Monday as they embark on a cruise on Monday afternoon. But the grounding of the flights has caused many headaches, with additional costs, she said: “We had to book another flight, which charged R3,500 per person, one way.” It remains unclear when the CAA would lift the suspension.
