Provincial hospitals are facing mounting debt and unpaid bills which has affected services in some of the province healthcare facilities after more than 42,000 suppliers were not paid within the legally required 30 days.

Bloom said that the department was plagued by financial mismanagement. "It's really appalling that the Gauteng Health Department owes more than R3 billion and to more than 42,000 suppliers and this is why we're seeing the problems at Chris Hani Baragwanath and also other problems at hospitals right around the province. Unfortunately, I think they're going to need a bailout but this must come with very strict conditions for decent financial management and put decent management in charge," Bloom said.
