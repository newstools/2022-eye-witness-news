DURBAN - Former president Jacob Zuma has approached the Supreme Court of Appeal following the dismissal of his latest bid to have State advocate Billy Downer removed from his corruption case. The Pietermaritzburg High Court ruled last year that Downer would continue prosecuting Zuma. Zuma requested Judge Piet Koen leave to appeal but he dismissed this as well. And added to this, Judge Koen said an appeal before the end of the trial would delay the matter, which is set to proceed in April. Zuma’s lawyers have submitted papers to the Supreme Court of Appeal to challenge the Pietermaritzburg High Court’s judgement. Spokesperson for the Jacob Zuma Foundation Mzwanele Manyi said: “The petition against the decision of Judge Koen dismissing the special plea for the removal of Billy Downer as prosecutor in the criminal case, as well as the application for leave to appeal and the application to lead new evidence was indeed lodged at the SCA today.” During a previous court appearance, Judge Koen told the court that the trial had to proceed. But Zuma has argued that Downer will not grant him a fair trial and wants him removed. Zuma alleges that Downer leaked vital information about him, including his medical records, to a journalist. The former president and French arms company Thales face corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering charges linked to the multibillion-rand arms deal.
