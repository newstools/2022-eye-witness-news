JOHANNESBURG - The leader of the vigilante group Operation Dudula, Nhlanhla “Lux” Dlamini, has urged his supporters not to turn to violence or take the law into their own hands in the wake of his arrest. His lawyer Ike Khumalo said his client was handcuffed on Thursday as he walked off the set of an interview. "I'm told that he went with officers to confirm his address so we'll hear when they come back, what the charges are," he said.

Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders accompanied Victor Ramerafe while he spoke to officers about the so-called raid on his home by the vigilante group on Sunday. Ramerafe said the group accused him of dealing drugs and assaulted him. Operation Dudula has been making headlines over the past few weeks for their unauthorised evictions of undocumented migrants in parts of Johannesburg.
