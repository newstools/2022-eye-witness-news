CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde will again ask that the national state of disaster be lifted at a meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday. On numerous occasions, Winde has requested the measure be scrapped. Instead, the government has further extended it - this time until mid-April. The disaster declaration's been in place for more than two years and governs the country's COVID-19 response.
