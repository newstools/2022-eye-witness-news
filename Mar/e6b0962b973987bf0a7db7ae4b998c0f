JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg emergency services have spent the night extinguishing a massive underground tunnel fire in the city centre. READ: No indication of when power will be restored in Joburg CBD Electricity cables planted inside the tunnel caught fire on Monday, cutting off power to residents and businesses around Fordsburg. Smoke is still billowing from the manholes leading to the underground tunnels where fire started.

EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said, “As soon as we have extinguished the fire, which we hope for by this afternoon, we will make sure the air quality is OK and the structural integrity of the tunnel is OK, then we will allow technicians to do their work.” #OutageUpdate #CityPowerUpdate #Fordsburg 90% of power has been restored to customers affected by the outage at Fordsburg Substation. ^OS pic.twitter.com/gv1XwCw6Fz
