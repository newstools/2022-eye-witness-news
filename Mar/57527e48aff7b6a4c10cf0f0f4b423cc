Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola: "We're surprised that Comair is acting as if they're unaware that we were coming. We absolutely did what we needed to do to get permission to picket. What we think this is is an attempt to silence us, it's an attempt to intimidate members. We're not going to be silenced. We're not going to withdraw our demands. Our demands are that Glenn Orsmond be removed." Hlubi-Majola said that Orsmond has failed to lead the company while workers made sacrifices to keep it afloat. "Three rounds of retrenchments have happened at Comair in a very short space of time. Up until last year in December, workers were earning only 70% of their salaries. At some point they didn't earn anything during the hard lockdown," Hlubi-Majola said.
