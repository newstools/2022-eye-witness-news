The past few weeks have seen protests at testing stations around Gauteng, with driving instructors prevented from making block bookings for students.

Despite the high backlog in driving licence renewals, and people complaining about the system, Minster Mbalula said that an extension for drivers needing to renew their licences was not possible. "The issue of the machine was made a big hullabaloo. I addressed that. The renewal will not be extended. I urged all the motorists to go to the different drivers' centres and renew their driver's licence because at the end of March we are not going to renew," the minister said. But Mbalula said that he would meet with driving schools soon to find solutions to some of the issues that they hadraised.
