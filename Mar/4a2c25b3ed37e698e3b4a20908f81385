JOHANNESBURG - The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) said the intention to suspend general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi is mischievous and malicious. The union’s national executive committee (NEC) held a briefing on Sunday following a quarterly meeting. The committee announced a decision to suspend four office bearers who championed Vavi’s suspension earlier this month. Saftu’s NEC has lambasted its president and three other office bearers for trying to suspend its general secretary, pointing out how the move was against the trade union federation’s constitution.
