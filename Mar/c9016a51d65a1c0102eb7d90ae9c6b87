Originally published here. We, scientists working in South Africa, strongly condemn the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Scientists play an important role in the development of just and peaceful societies and we cannot stay silent when fundamental values, basic human rights and international law are violated. We are shocked by the brutal attacks of the Russian army on civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools, universities, research institutes, and hospitals. We are also extremely worried about nuclear power plants in Ukraine being captured by the Russian Armed Forces, where our fellow-scientists are working now under tremendous stress at gunpoint. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people whose lives are currently endangered. We call for an immediate stop of the violence and withdrawal of all Russian troops from internationally recognised Ukrainian territory as proclaimed in the UN resolution. We would also like to state the following: We are deeply disappointed with the abstention of South Africa on the UN resolution that called for the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces from the territory of Ukraine. We believe that to ensure peace and possibility of negotiations the violence perpetrated by the Russian Federation must be stopped. We strongly believe that South African academic institutions should align themselves with the strong response against the invasion among scientists and academics worldwide. We also strongly urge South Africa to provide support through offering temporary positions for fleeing Ukrainian scientists and possibilities for Ukraine-based students to finish their studies. This especially concerns African students where the South African government is obliged to take vigorous action to ensure the safety, possibility of repatriation, and availability of alternative educational opportunities. It must be remembered that South Africa benefitted significantly from international solidarity, which contributed to the peaceful transition from apartheid. Now it is our time to show solidarity in the fight for fundamental values. Finally, we strongly oppose governmental attempts to silence research bodies in South Africa, instructing not to engage in activities that could be construed as a political commentary or political reaction to the developments in Ukraine. The freedom of speech is a constitutional right of everyone, and we affirm the right of South African scientists and institutions to speak out following their conscience. We urge the research entities to not allow being censored.
