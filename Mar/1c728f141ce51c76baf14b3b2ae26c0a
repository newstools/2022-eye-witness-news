JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa said the mining industry needed to be protected as it was the backbone of the country's economy, pumping billions into the fiscus. He was addressing the 17th National Union of Mineworkers conference taking place in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The president said the increase in commodity prices and increased output had created billions for the fiscus. "Last year, corporate income tax receipts for mining increased government revenues by close to R100 billion." And he said there were support mechanisms to support this. "Because of its centrality to economic growth, government has prioritised structural forms to improve the business and operating environment for mining, particularly with regards to electricity generation and water use." Protecting jobs, fighting against retrenchments, and the privatisation and unbundling of Eskom will be some of the major issues under the spotlight at the conference. WATCH: Ramaphosa promises an end to the state of disaster soon  STATE OF DISASTER Ramaphosa said South Africa was ready for the national state of disaster to end and that was why government was looking to do this as early as next week. The national state of disaster was declared in March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic but the president said things were taking a good turn for South Africa. Ramphosa said from a social and economic perspective, South Africa entered this year differently than the year before. He said this was made possible by those who managed the COVID-19 pandemic. Ramaphosa said the country could now close the national state of disaster chapter. The ANC president said members of the public were no longer satisfied with the lockdown. “Many of our people want to have their freedom back, this is precisely what government is working on. I can safely say with certainty that the national state of disaster is going to end.” However, he said they would continue to assess the situation.
