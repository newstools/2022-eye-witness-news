CAPE TOWN - South Africans will hopefully be able to keep their lights on this week, but sceptics will not be holding their breath. The country was plunged into darkness last week, with the sudden return of nationwide blackouts. However, Eskom announced that they would be suspending Sunday night's planned power cut, after regaining enough generating capacity. #PowerAlert1Loadshedding will be suspended at 20:00 tonight as generation capacity sufficiently recovers.

This was partly due to scheduled maintenance, but largely as a result of failures at their coal-powered generators. On Sunday, they announced that losses had been reduced to around 19,000MW, enough of an improvement to suspend the rolling blackouts. But that's still a big gap in generating capacity and means that the grid will remain under pressure on Monday and Tuesday. Furthermore, Eskom is expecting that they'll need to heavily rely on emergency reserves in the meantime, which is not good news in the face of soaring fuel prices. Once again, the embattled power utility has apologised to South Africans for the blackouts and is still calling on all of us to use electricity sparingly.
