JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 8 pm on Tuesday on developments in South Africa’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This after government once again extended the state of disaster to 15 April. There have been growing calls for the lockdown to be lifted and COVID-19 regulations to be scrapped. Wits University’s Professor of vaccinology Shabir Madhi said there was little reason for the president to justify keeping the state of disaster. “Hopefully, the president has come up with a way forward to get us back to some form of normalcy.”
