JOHANNESBURG - A former McDonald’s employee will spend 10 years in jail for extorting a manager after recording himself spitting in a McFlurry ice-cream. Clement Seothaeng worked at a Pretoria branch of the fast-food restaurant. After recording the video, he posed as a concerned customer demanding R150,000 to stop the video from being circulated. The 27-year-old was arrested in September 2017 when he was trapped by authorities after the manager laid a criminal complaint. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to 10 years for extortion and five years for malicious damage to property that will run concurrently. The NPA’s Lumka Mahanjana said: “The NPA welcomes the sentence of a former McDonald’s employee who was sentenced by the Pretoria North Magistrates Court to 10 years direct imprisonment after he was convicted of extortion and malicious damage to property.”
