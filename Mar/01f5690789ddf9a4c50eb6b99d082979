After doing research to be able to find the challenges he endured to be where was, motivated me to document his story.” Morgan also shared that the one enduring characteristic that stuck with him as he chronicled Mapimpi’s life is that the giant who led South Africa to World Cup glory is indeed humble and true to himself.
