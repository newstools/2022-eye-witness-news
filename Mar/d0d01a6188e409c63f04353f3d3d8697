CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa will no longer have to face a motion of no confidence. It was meant to be debated and voted on Wednesday but it's now lapsed and is no longer on the parliamentary programme. The matter came under discussion at a National Assembly programming committee meeting on Thursday morning. The African Transformation Movement (ATM)’s motion has fallen off the National Assembly programme and the party will have to table a fresh motion. The ATM’s Vuyo Zungula maintained again on Thursday morning that the matter should not be withdrawn because of the party’s pending court challenge on a secret ballot. “It is not a matter that I declined just because I just wanted to decline. It is a matter of principle that it is a matter before the courts on the method which the motion will be voted on,” Zungula said. National Assembly secretary Masibulele Xaso told the programming committee that a motion lapses if it is not moved by a member of Parliament on the day that it's been scheduled to be heard. Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said that members could always resubmit the motion: “It doesn’t matter if the party tells us tomorrow that they are ready now because issues have been dealt with by the court. It will be a resubmission of the motion - it will not be a resuscitation of the motion.” WATCH: Motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramaphosa postponed
