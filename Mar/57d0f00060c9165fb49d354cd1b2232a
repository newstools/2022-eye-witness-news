He said that a unit each at the Matla, Kendal, Matimba, Kusile and Grootvlei power stations tripped, while a unit each at the Arnot and Hendrina power stations were forced to shut down. "This, in addition to other units that had tripped during the weekend, reduced generation capacity, forcing Eskom to rely heavily on emergency generation reserves to keep the lights on. Total breakdowns amount to 15,228MW, while planned maintenance is 6,307MW of capacity as we continue with the reliability maintenance," Mantshantsha said.
