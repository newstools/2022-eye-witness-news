JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - Professor of vaccinology Shabir Madhi on Tuesday said the government was oblivious to having any meaningful goal insight around the COVID-19 pandemic. He has responded to the latest extension of the national state of disaster, saying it kept being rolled over because there was no plan. Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma announced earlier in the day that the state of disaster would be lengthened by another month to 15 April. Dlamini-Zuma said the government needed to continue adapting existing laws to try to control the spread of the virus. Madhi said the government's latest move came as no surprise. "I had hoped the government would chart a way forward to get their act together, that would have been a welcomed surprise. I can't say I'm completely disappointed."

The cumulative number of recoveries now stand at 3 577 338 with a recovery rate of 96.8% pic.twitter.com/NYjYmA593g  'POWER GRAB' The Democratic Alliance said the extension was “nothing a but a power grab” from government. DA shadow minister of cooperative governance Cilliers Brink said the extension came without any scientific backing. “The disaster in this country has nothing to do with COVID-19 and everything to do with an incompetent government that is clinging to its lockdown powers.” Meanwhile, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde said it was unacceptable that government had months to prepare alternative public health measures, yet was unable to roll them out to replace the national state of disaster.
