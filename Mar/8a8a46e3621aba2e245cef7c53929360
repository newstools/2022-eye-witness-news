CAPE TOWN - Agri SA said that employment in skilled agriculture has not bounced back to 2020 levels. In quarter four of that year, around 85,000 skilled workers were employed in the sector, compared to 68,000 during the same timeframe last year. Agri SA said that it was concerning as this “drop in skilled employment represents a brain drain for the sector”. The organisation's labour affairs head, Lebogang Sethusha, explained that these jobs ranged from harvest operators, to agricultural machine and equipment operators. "From farmworkers to diesel mechanics to the high-level agriculture farm managers, starter managers, application and development managers as well as hydrologists and food and beverage scientists. So it's a wide range across the value chain," Sethusha said. Sethusha, however, said that overall employment in the sector had increased by 38,000 jobs quarter-on-quarter to 868,000 jobs in quarter four of 2021. Agri SA highlighted that growth in the sector was being hampered by challenges such as poor road, rail and port infrastructure.
