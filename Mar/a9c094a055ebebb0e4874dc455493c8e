DURBAN - A visit by officials in KwaZulu-Natal to try and get to the bottom of allegations of racism at two schools has been disrupted. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members prevented the province’s Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu from addressing pupils. The MEC visited the Grosvenor Girls High School in Bluff, south of Durban on Tuesday morning, where he met with the school governing body and parents. But chaos ensued just as he was about to address pupils at the assembly.

All those stories must be told in the independent commission. The management, principal and the team will do the same, and the pupils will also do the same,” Mshengu said. The MEC was then barred from speaking to the pupils by EFF eThekwini councillors and some party members. The party wants those accused of racism to be suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. EFF eThekwini chairperson Themba Mvubu said: “There is no logical conclusion as to why the perpetrators must roam these school premises freely while there are serious allegations of racism against them.” The MEC said that he would not be intimidated by the EFF, describing Tuesday morning’s chaotic scenes as a destruction to education.
