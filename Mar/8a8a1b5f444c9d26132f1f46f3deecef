CAPE TWON - All Comair-operated flights, including Kulula.com and British Airways, have been cancelled for Saturday. This comes as the Civil Aviation Authority suspended the group's operating certificate, following an investigation into safety concerns. There's been a reported spate of safety incidents at the operator. The authority said just in the past month, Comair operations experienced incidents ranging from engine failures, engine malfunction, and landing gear malfunctions - amongst others. The suspension is in place for 24 hours, while Comair has been ordered to demonstrate its risk and management systems are effective. Comair issued a notice of the suspension on kulula.com's website and Twitter account on Saturday."Comair believes there is no justification for the suspension," the notice read. Hi Don, unfortunately we cannot disclose this information however, we do believe that the suspension is unjustified. - AR
