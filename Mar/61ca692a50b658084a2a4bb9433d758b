JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Health on Wednesday published proposed COVID-19 health regulations outside the national state of disaster for public comments. Government is calling for public consultation on alternative legislation for managing the pandemic after it extended the policy for another month. Spokesperson Foster Mohale said they were asking for a meaningful input into the decision-making process. “This is part of government’s transition plans to the current national state of disaster, which has been in place for more than two years sine it was declared in March 2020.” In a statement, the department said the proposed regulations sought to introduce a number of control measures. "As part of efforts to manage transmission during large gatherings considered to be possible super-spreader events, the regulations proposed the restriction of night vigils and after-funeral gatherings. The indoor and outdoor gatherings will be may be occupied up to 50% of the venue capacity provided there is production of a valid vaccine certificate; practice of social distance of at least one metre and compulsory wearing of mask. "The attendance of indoor gatherings without proof of vaccination will be limited to only 1,000 people and 2,000 for outdoors with social distancing of at least one metre social distance." It adds that the regulations will be implemented as soon as they're approved.
