The family at Mahlongwa on the South Coast is preparing for the child's funeral on Saturday. They were left stunned and shocked after the child’s uncle Njabulo saw the boy’s body lying in a bush. He told Eyewitness News that the family wanted closure. “When I saw my nephew sleeping there, his eyes were gouged out and that was a shock to me. I doubt anyone could relate to how I felt. He also had a big wound on the left-hand side of his head.” A night vigil would be held at the family home ahead of the funeral on Saturday.
