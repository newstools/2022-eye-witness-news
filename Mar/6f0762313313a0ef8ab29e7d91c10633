CAPE TOWN - Detectives are still on the scene of another mass shooting in Khayelitsha that claimed six lives.

Police vehicles were parked on a bridge in Lindela Road, where the fatal shooting took place. The bodies were discovered at two scenes, 200 metres apart. A sixth person died in hospital. On Monday, Eyewitness News spoke to a relative of one the victims. “That girl was still young. We [were] still expecting a lot from her so, we are very sad as a family, we are not happy. We can be happy if the police can do something.” This latest mass shooting comes a week after five people were shot and killed in Khayelitsha's Endlovini informal settlement. #KhayelitshaShooting 5 people were shot and killed in the Endlovini Informal Settlement, also in Khayelitsha, last week.
