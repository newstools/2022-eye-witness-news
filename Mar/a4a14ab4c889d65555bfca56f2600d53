CAPE TOWN - All flights operating under Comair, including British Airways and Kulula, have been cancelled indefinitely. The suspension on their operating license, due to major safety risks, remained in place on Sunday. READ: CAA says Comair knew about safety issues that led to planes being grounded Following last week's lengthy investigation into incidents such as engine failures, landing gear malfunctions, and reports with recommendation to fix them, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) invoked a 24 suspension of Comair's operating license on Saturday. The company had been given several opportunities to prove how they had addressed safety concerns and risks but CAA spokesperson Phindiwe Gwebu said they still could not be cleared for safe flying. Taking to the Kulula Twitter account on Sunday, Comair confirmed that it would not be able to resume operations. According to the company, the Civil Aviation Authority still needs to review the documentation it provided overnight. "We continue to engage constructively with the SACAA", the company tweeted. Despite working through the night, Comair will not be able to resume operations today. The SACAA still needs to review documentation provided overnight. We continue to engage constructively with the SACAA.  PASSENGERS LEFT STRANDED Eyewitness News believes several hopeful passengers have been queuing at local airports but Gwebu cautioned against this. In a statement, Comair said their priority was to assist passengers who had been stranded, chartering two aircrafts to assist vulnerable passengers and those who most urgently needing to travel. It has urged passengers not to overcrowd airports. Only vulnerable or emergency travel passengers were currently being assisted. Passengers with Kulula and British Airways have been advised not to go to the airport unless:- They had made their own alterative flight arrangements; or- They had received an SMS from the company instructing them of when to arrive.
