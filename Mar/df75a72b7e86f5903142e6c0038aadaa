JOHANNESBURG - The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) on Wednesday said it had suspended Lufthansa Technik. The aircraft maintenance organisations (AMO) is responsible for the maintaining Comair’s fleet. “The suspension follows a four-day audit, which started on 15 March 2022. The audit of the both the AMOs maintaining the Comair fleet follows the conclusion of the airline’s audit by the SACAA following a spate of incidents taking place from February 2022.” The regulator said the audit followed a series of safety issues with Comair’s planes. “The audit resulted in four Level 1 findings raised with the AMO. A Level 1 finding poses an immediate risk to users of civil aviation services and such findings must be closed immediately.” The regulator’s Phindiwe Gwebu said the company had 24 hours to resolve the issues. “Following the 24-hour precautionary suspension, the operator is expected to provide a corrective action plan as well as new evidence. However, if they fail to do this, it means they will be suspended indefinitely.” This week, Comair shifted the maintenance and day-to-day aircraft checks of its fleet away from the international maintenance company to South African Airways Technical in a bid to remedy concerns about the safety of the airline. Comair's Kulula and local British Airways flights were also temporarily suspended by SACAA earlier this month. This inconvenienced thousands of passengers who couldn't fly, get refunds or secure alternative flights.
