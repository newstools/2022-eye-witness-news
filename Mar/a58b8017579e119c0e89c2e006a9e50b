JOHANNESBURG - The Gautrain on Tuesday suspended its bus services following protest action by its drivers. The train service, however, is operating according to schedule, the operator said on social media. Please note that there is no bus service at all stations, including Park Station, due to intimidation from bus drivers who are protesting. Train service is operating according to schedule. The midi-bus service is also operating as usual. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.  The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa)'s national motor organiser Mduduzi Nkosi told Eyewitness News that the protest action stemmed from an internal conflict. "We know negotiations are deadlocked, but the issue is depot based," he said. Nkosi added: "There has been a difficult relationship between Gautrain and our workers there."
