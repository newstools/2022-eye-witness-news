CAPE TOWN - Small businesses continue to bear the brunt of sudden and escalating load shedding. Eskom first implemented Stage 2 load shedding this week after breakdowns at power plants. However, that had to be ramped up to Stage 4 when more units broke down and then downgraded to stage 3 when it noted some recovery in generation capacity in Thursday. Barber Rod Vonga shared a working space with a hairdresser in a small shop along Voortrekker Road in Parow, Cape Town. They were hit by load shedding just as Vonga finished a client's haircut and his next client was turned away. Hairdresser Anekwe Mirocoe could fortunately continue braiding a client's hair. However, after load shedding hits, many clients cancelled their appointments. This directly impacted on her ability to put food on the table.
