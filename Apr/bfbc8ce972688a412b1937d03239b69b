CAPE TOWN - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has told supporters that poverty in South Africa is due to a lack of land ownership. EFF supporters gathered outside business tycoon Johann Ruperts' Remgro Limited office block in Stellenbosch after a march on Wednesday. The EFF are observing the day that Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck arrived on the shores of Cape Town on 6 April 1652. READ: Tycoon Johann Rupert must redistribute his wealth, says EFF ahead of march Malema said land and resources should be returned to their rightful owners. "This youth is here during working hours in their numbers because they are not working and because they have no land to work on. Our poverty is because of lack of ownership of land." Malema said the party wanted a peaceful distribution of land. "There is no future in South Africa without the ownership of land." #EFFLandDay We are here to say to Rupert, your riches come from the exploitation of black people, Malema tells the crowd.

As you are aware, we have tried in terms of the Land Expropriation Without Compensation Bill but we're not going to limit ourselves to that legal process because our participation in Parliament is to push its parameters to see how far we get legal means of restoring the dignity of our people." #EFFLandDay Supporters on the road marching, led by party leader Julius Malema. @kaylynnpalm pic.twitter.com/R9Hsvi0pXg
