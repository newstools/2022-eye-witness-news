CAPE TOWN - Western Cape residents have until 30 April to get counted in the 2022 census. Premier Alan Winde is concerned that the province is still lagging too far behind the rest of the country. StatsSA said that the Western Cape's count stood at about 55%, while the average number counted in the rest pf country was sitting at 87%. Winde warned that if residents did not get counted, the province would be perceived to have a lower population than it actually had despite significant population growth. He said that this will have a direct impact on budget allocations: “It is really important that people are counted because it is our planning tool, budgeting tool. That is how we receive funding from National Treasury.” Winde said that the process has been plagued by numerous issues: "It’s a range of issues. In the discussion that we had with them, at the moment, we have 2,000 counting officials from Limpopo in the Western Cape."
