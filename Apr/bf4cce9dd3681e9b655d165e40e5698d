JOHANNESBURG - Siya Kolisi is giving back by building the next generation of rugby players through a clinic to help upskill and empower them. The first clinic was held in Durban and the young women and men received a motivation talk from the country’s finest rugby players, including Kolisi himself. The Kolisi Foundation said investing in the youth through rugby is one of the reasons the foundation was established.
