City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena: "We are on-site to basically ensure that when the heat subsides we are able to get in and do assessments of the cost to repair, the people affected and also the cause of the fire." Mangena said that technicians were also working on restoring neighbouring substations affected by the incident. "Because of the smoke and the inter-connectedness of these substations, Orlando Fordsburg has also tripped – Eldorado Park is fed from the Orlando Fordsburg line, so it also tripped upstream, so we are also having some areas that are out."
