During a post-award interview with the Recording Academy, Maphumulo expressed gratitude for winning his first-ever Grammy. “I just won a Grammy! First nomination, first Grammy, unbelievable! At first, it was intentional to create an album that would be recognised on this level. Being someone who comes from South Africa or Africa, where most of our artists are categorised together, so, I was very intentional with what I wanted to do with this album where it would compete on a global scale with people that I think of as my peers,” he said. To think that someone who went to the same school as I did just won a Grammy 🥺🥺🥺🥺Phakama Zimele High  (former Zimele  JSS)🤌🏾🍾🥺Black Coffee is living our wildest dreams.

The award is not for me, but to show them that it’s not about music alone, but about anything they want to do. This is to show them that it is possible,” Maphumulo said.
