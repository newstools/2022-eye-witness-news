MPUMALANGA - The ANC in Mpumalanga has elected Mandla Ndlovu as the party's provincial chairperson. He effectively takes over from David Mabuza who left the province in 2017 when he was elected as the ANC’s deputy president. READ: ANC votes on preferred candidates Ndlovu and Ndinisa as party’s Mpumalanga chair. Out of 718 votes, Ndlovu secured 440 while his contender Lucky Ndinisa managed to get 278 votes. Ndlovu’s slate took all top five positions with murder-accused Mandla Msibi also being elected provincial treasurer. Msibi did not attend the gathering. He stepped aside from the party last year over murder charges he faces. #ANCMP Ndlovu officially taking over from DD Mabuza who was elected ANC deputy president in 2017.
