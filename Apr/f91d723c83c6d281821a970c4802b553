The Mr Price Group is expanding into more upmarket clothing with the acquisition of a majority stake in Studio 88 Group. Studio 88 is a South African clothing and footwear retailer that stocks international brands like Levi's, Adidas and Vans. Mr Price said in a statement that it will pay 3.3 billion rand in cash for a 70% stake in Studio 88’s owner Blue Falcon Trading 188. "Studio 88 Group has broad appeal to aspirational and trend conscious customers across a wide range of age profiles and affordability levels."   The acquisition comes just more than a year after Mr Price bought Yuppiechef for R460 million.
