The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked the National Assembly Speaker to investigate the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa over his war-of-words with  Eskom board member Busisiwe Mavuso last week at a parliamentary meeting. Hlengwa repremanded Mavuso for saying that the African National Congress  was responsible for Eskom's woes leading to him ordering her to leave the meeting.
