JOHANNESBURG - The motion of no confidence against the speaker in the City of Johannesburg, Vasco Da Gama, has been withdrawn. Minority party Al Jama-ah, which had tabled the motion, announced that it was withdrawing out of respect for Da Gama who is in mourning due to a family bereavement. The party is accusing him of allowing the Democratic Alliance's political stance to interfere with council business thus failing to safeguard its independence - among other listed reasons. Da Gama had recused himself from council proceedings and handed over to the chair of chairs Colleen Makubela when Al Jama-ah's Thapelo Ahmed relayed their decision. "The multi-party opposition comes to a consensus to allow the process bereavement for the speaker because we are Africans above all so we would love to withdraw and sympathise pretty soon we will re-table the motion". This would not be the first time the speaker is challenged in his position in 2019 Da Gama was voted out through a motion of no confidence.
