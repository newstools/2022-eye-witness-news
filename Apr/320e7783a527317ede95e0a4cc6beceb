      The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says government has betrayed  poor and working class South Africans who rely on the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant for survival. Last week, the Department of Social Development (DSD) published new regulations outlining a revised system for the dispensation of the R350 grant.

Cosatu says lowering the income threshold means that nearly three million previous recipients will now be excluded from receiving the relief. The trade union federation has described the move as a callous decision that intensifies government's "war against the poor". Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla says  President Cyril Ramaphosa's administration has proven that it is unreliable and can no longer be trusted. Pamla says Ramaphosa is reneging on a promise that he made to South Africans at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. "It's clear now that as workers and the poor, we cannot trust this administration," he says. We have to say, we are very disappointed by this decision because we sat at Nedlac as social partners to discuss the introduction of this special relief dispensation grant.  In our engagement with the government, we made it very clear that issues like the R350 grant and the basic income grant are very important for us when it comes to a social compact... now to hear that government has taken this decision, is very disappointing.  We estimate that plus-minus 3 million people are going to be left out and will no longer be eligible. This is really a betrayal of the working class... He [Ramaphosa] is giving everything to the private sector while pickpocketing the poor and unemployed.
