CAPE TOWN - Gerda Steyn set a new record in the 56km Two Oceans Marathon as she went on to claim a third consecutive title in Cape Town on Sunday. She beat Frith van der Merwe's previous course record of 3:30:36, by becoming the first woman to break the 3.5 hour barrier in the race with a time of 3:29:42. She's also the first athlete in 22 years to win three consecutive titles. Irvette van Zyl finished second to complete a South African one-two on the podium. Steyn won the race in 2018, 2019 and 2022. The Two Oceans Marathon didn't take place in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. RELATED: Zimbabwean athletes dominate Two Oceans half marathon It’s official - our TRIPLE CROWN QUEEN IS HOME!
