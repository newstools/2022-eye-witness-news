JOHANNESBURG - A former State Security Agency employee was sentenced to six years imprisonment for stealing R170,000 from the organisation. Finance clerk, Kgaogelo Bopape, appeared in Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court for sentencing on Monday morning. She pleaded guilty to theft. “The NPA hopes that this sentence will send a strong message that such crimes of theft, corruption and fraud will not be tolerated,” said the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)’s Lumka Mahanjana.
