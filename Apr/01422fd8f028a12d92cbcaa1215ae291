JOHANNESBURG - The South African Weather Service says parts of the country will see more torrential rainfall as dangerous flash flooding risks hitting already drenched areas. Several warnings of widespread thunderstorms, flash floods and strong winds were issued for parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape as well as the Free State. Last week's sustained downpours left a trail of destruction claiming over 400 lives while 72 people, including children are still missing. Forecaster Venetia Phakula said they had issued level 4 warning for localised flooding and mud slides, especially in informal settlements. SANDF DEPLOYMENT Meanwhile the South African Defence Force has been hard at work assisting those affected by the heavy rains. Less than 500 out of the 10,000 troops earmarked for emergency, relief and reconstruction operations have been deployed to assist victims in flood-stricken KwaZulu-Natal. General Andres Mahapa says joint operations between civilian and military search teams are still recovering bodies from the debris more than a week after the disaster struck.
