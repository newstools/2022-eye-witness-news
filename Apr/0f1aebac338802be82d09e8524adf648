JOHANNESBURG - One of the suspects arrested in connection with the robbery and attack of well-known Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu has been granted bail of R3,000. The 87-year-old world-renowned Ndebele artist was attacked in her Siyabuswa home last month in Mpumalanga. The suspect was handcuffed along with an alleged accomplice on Thursday after police in that province received a tip-off. Mpumalanga police said the accomplice will be remanded in custody. Both the suspects have been charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm and house robbery. “Today the first suspect was remanded in custody until 20 April for formal bail application. It was indicated that he is more likely to intimidate the witnesses and that’s why he has to be remanded in custody,” said the police’s Brigadier Selvy Mohlala.
