CAPE TOWN - The International News Media Association (INMA) has pulled the controversial Tembisa 10 story from a shortlist for the upcoming global media awards. Last year, Pretoria News ran what they called an "exclusive story" that claimed a 37-year-old Gauteng woman had broken a Guinness World Record by carrying and delivering 10 babies, but the report was never verified.

Independent Media launched a video series about the birth of the decuplets even after the story could not be verified.

The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) wrote to INMA requesting it reconsider the nomination. It labeled the story ludicrous and an embarrassment to South African journalism.
