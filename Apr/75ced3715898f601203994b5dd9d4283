MANGAUNG - Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela says the Mangaung Municipality is plagued with several issues, including service delivery challenges. Ntombela delivered the welcome address at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein where President Cyril Ramaphosa is visiting for the second post-State of the Nation Address Presidential Imbizo. This event is meant to help with discussing ways of how service delivery could be improved. Ntombela thanked the president for his work, saying “Mr President, we thank you. You bring us hope and raise us. You did the unthinkable and saved us from COVID-19. You saved us at a time that we had lost hope. You stood firm and strong.” Some residents criticised Ramaphosa for failing to act on municipalities that failed to deliver services to communities. Resident Thabiso Kgadiyenyana said the president had failed to put pressure on local government officials. “We do not get service delivery at all. When it comes to the rubbish being collected, it’s a problem. When you go all over the streets of Mangaung you find rubbish. It is true, Mr President, when you come to Bloemfontein, that is the only time we see these roads being cleaned.”
