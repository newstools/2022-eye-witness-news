Following the postponement of the interdict case of Busisiwe Mkhwebane, more information has come to light about the SMS that was sent to Andrew Breitenbach, a member of the legal council for Parliament, by Ismail Abramjee.

He is a self-described legal commentator who sent an SMS to Brietenbach saying he “had it on very good authority” that Mkhwebane’s recission case was going to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court.
