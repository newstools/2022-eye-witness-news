      "Would you like to tap?" It's become a common question at till points across the country but not all South Africans trust contactless bank cards. In South Africa, no signature or PIN is required when using contactless bank cards for transactions under R500. Consumer journalist Wendy Knowler says many bank clients still fear that the "tap-and-go" feature on bank cards is easy for criminals to exploit. However, the ombudsman for banking services says complaints about fraud related to contactless bank cards remain relatively low. The ombud says about two cases per month were reported in the last year. So, can card holders deactivate the popular  "tap-and-go" feature on their cards if they want to? According to Knowler, all but one of SA's "big five" banks allow consumers to disable the function. Here's a look at what each of them says:      "All FNB cards are contactless-enabled and the function can’t be disabled as it is a core feature of the product,” says FNB Card CEO, Chris Labuschagne. “We encourage our customers to transition to device NFC payments and the use of virtual cards as the next evolution of payment convenience and security.” This article first appeared on CapeTalk : Can you turn off the 'tap and go' on your card?
