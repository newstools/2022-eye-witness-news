It's a small unit, but still every megawatt counts. Kendal 6, that is a big unit, that returned to service at 6am this morning, so that was very welcome but we tripped Majuba 6 just past 8am this morning," De Ruyter said. De Ruyter said that Eskom was experiencing minor interruptions in KwaZulu-Natal due to isolated incidents but would not be cutting power to the eThekwini Municipality. "By and large, from an Eskom perspective, our grid is still intact, we have some minor interruptions in isolated areas where there are some short-term interruptions. We have offered our assistance to municipalities in KZN to help with spares, maintenance crews - those discussions are ongoing," he said.
