A crowd of about 100 people who had gathered at the corner of JB Marks and William Nicol streets have moved inside the township. As locals call for an intervention against crime, a resident played a voice note reporting an alleged murder from Tuesday night. The man, who runs a salon in Diepsloot, said that he was also a victim recently. "When I knock off, I take my things home. They came after me at around 9 - they took my batteries, my phones and my money. They pointed guns at us," he said. A police nyala is parked at the top of the street keeping a watchful eye on the situation.
