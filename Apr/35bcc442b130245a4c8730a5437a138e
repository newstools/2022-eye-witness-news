CAPE TOWN - A 16-year-old boy will make his first appearance in the Ladismith Magistrate's Court on Friday morning in connection with the murder of a seven-year-old boy. The child's burnt body was discovered in a shallow grave at the Hartmansleegte farm in Hoekoe on Tuesday. His family last saw him alive on Friday. During a two-day probe, investigators gathered sufficient evidence and witness statements that linked the 16-year-old accused to the crime. He cannot be named because he is a minor and will appear in-camera at the local magistrate's court. Results of a DNA test and an autopsy have not yet been concluded but police said that their investigation so far indicated that the body was that of the seven-year-old boy, who was reported missing by relatives on Monday. At first, the deceased's mother assumed he was visiting his grandmother, who lives on a different farm. However, the woman grew worried when she realised that he was not there and she called police.
