JOHANNESBURG - Business Unity boss and Eskom board member Busisiwe Mavuso has stormed out of a meeting with Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). Scopa met with the Eskom board during a visit to Megawatt Park on Friday. A heated exchange erupted between Mavuso and Scopa Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa. Mavuso said that despite all the challenges the organisation faced, they would not allow the board and CEO Andre de Ruyter to be the “fall guy” for the mess that Eskom was experiencing and for the ANC-led government. #Eskom's #BusisiweMavuso has stormed out of a meeting with Scopa after a heated exchange in which she said they would not be the "fall guys" for the ANC-led government's failures.

He added that Mavuso was an Eskom board member and accordingly she had to account for the institution the ANC had deployed her to.
