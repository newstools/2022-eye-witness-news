With the national national state of disaster that was implemented due to COVID-19 coming to an end, those who were previously receiving the R350 social relief of distress grants will have to re-apply, according to the Department of Social Development. Africa Melane spoke to Paseka Letsatsi, the head of communications at Sassa, about why this needs to happen and the process that will be followed.
