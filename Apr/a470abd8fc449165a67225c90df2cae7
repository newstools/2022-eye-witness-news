CAPE TOWN - South Africa is set to miss its malaria elimination target for a second time in a decade. Monday, 25 April marks World Malaria Day. The World Health Organization on Monday said that progress in eradicating the disease had stalled in recent years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa missed its target in 2018. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)'s Professor Jaishree Raman said: "The region has a target to try and eliminate malaria by 2023, which means programmes and healthcare professionals need to ensure every malaria case is detected."
