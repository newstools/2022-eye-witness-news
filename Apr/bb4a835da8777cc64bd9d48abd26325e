JOHANNESBURG - Slain Soweto doctor George Koboka has been described by colleagues as a champion of many disciplines. Koboka was gunned down at his surgery in Diepkloof last week after four men stormed in while he was attending to patients. This attack followed a robbery at his surgery the week before. 'The People's Doctor', as he was affectionately known, was laid to rest in a private service at the Nasrec Memorial Park. His friend Dr Stephen Mankupane said Koboka was a gifted individual.
