"There must be a concrete contribution by someone who has amassed so much wealth on the back of black people to contribute to our upliftment because that wealth is not his own. He is the benefactor of that first colonial crime of land theft in 1652, so he must redistribute that wealth. That is the concrete proposal we will give to him," Temba said. The Stellenbosch Municipality has authorised the march, which is expected to start at 11am. EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu is expected to lead a similar march at one of Rupert’s farms in Mpumalanga on Wednesday.
