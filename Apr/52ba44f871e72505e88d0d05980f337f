JOHANNESBURG - Though Thabani Nyawose lost the battle to control the African National Congress (ANC) in eThekwini, he’s already offered to support suspected criminal Zandile Gumede saying they share a vision for the region’s future. Although victorious, Gumede is not participating in any party activities having stepped aside over the multiple corruption charges she’s facing. A letter from Gumede accepting nomination was read out at the regional conference. The staunch ally of former president Jacob Zuma secured 210 votes, beating Nyawose’s 181.

Though corruption accused and sitting at home due to the step aside resolution, she’s remained popular and received more votes from delegates even though she was not physically present at the conference. WATCH: Zandile Gumede voted in as ANC's eThekwini regional chairperson  Her opponent, Nyawose, said he’s at peace with election outcomes: “We agreed that they have a responsibility to make sure the ANC in eThekwini is strong. We even said, whoever wins the conference has to be supported.” Meanwhile some of the embattled political leader’s supporters continue to claim she has the right qualities to lead the eThekwini metro.
