CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town is appealing to residents to donate goods that will be sent to KwaZulu-Natal. Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said that donations could be dropped off at the Roeland Street fire station, Lakeside fire station as well as the fire stations in Strand, Goodwood and Bellville. "Capetonians are a generous people, we help out in difficult times and so I'm calling on all Capetonians to help out at this difficult time by dropping off donated fresh water, non-perishable food and blankets at the list of fire stations and city facilities," Hill-Lewis said. Hill-Lewis said that the municipality had sent a team of emergency response personnel to KZN, as part of a multidisciplinary team assembled by the Western Cape government. "We've also been in touch with the mayor of Durban and we are sending a team of Cape Town's best fire and rescue staff and disaster management staff to KZN, to eThekwini to help out in this difficult time," the mayor said. Humanitarian and search and rescue efforts have intensified, with a state of disaster declared in the province.
