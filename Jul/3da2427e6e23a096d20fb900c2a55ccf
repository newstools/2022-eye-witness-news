"It's the culmination of a number of things - one the one side we have training for science teachers to build their efficiency to teach science effectively, what I call building the culture of science teaching," Hartley said. Garden Cities Archway Foundation CEO, John Matthews, explains that they had so far opened 85 of these laboratories across the Western Cape. "This is a necessity in terms of the advancement of science and maths and we would like to inculcate the behaviour in our junior schools, not just high schools, to love science and maths," Matthews said. The Norma Road Primary School in Silvertown and Sokhanyo Primary in Gugulethu have also opened their new science laboratories.
