Eskom announced on Saturday evening that load shedding will move up to stage 4 on Sunday at 4 pm, followed by stage 2 power cuts until 5 am on Monday. Stage 3 will be in force from 7 am until 4 pm on Sunday. The power utility says this escalation is due to the loss of five large generation units over the past 36 hours, as well as a delay in returning five other units to service. #POWERALERT1Stage 4 loadshedding will be implemented on Sunday afternoon, with varying stages of loadshedding implemented during the week. pic.twitter.com/tQB70UlK3J  Stage 4 will also be implemented from 5 am on Monday until midnight.
