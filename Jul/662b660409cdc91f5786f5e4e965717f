DURBAN - The ANC in KZN has described the Nasrec National Executive Committee (NEC) as a spectacular failure – coming up short in both attempts to unify and produce a disciplined political party. Its organisational report questions the whereabouts of the NEC – when its own members undermine the organisation in public and on social media. The outgoing Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) also warned that this cultivates and entrenches a culture of impunity which is in direct conflict with the 2017 conference resolutions of unity and renewal.
