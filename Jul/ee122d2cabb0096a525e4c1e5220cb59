JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has moved to quell tensions amid a flurry of threats to shut down the country over a myriad of issues. This is on the back of calls for the President to step down, with some South Africans accusing him of failing to effectively lead the country out of the many  crises  it faces. Anger has been rising over several challenges that are reducing South Africans' quality of life on an everyday basis. This includes rolling blackouts and the cost of living crisis. The growing threats of nationwide shutdowns over the difficult living conditions in the country appear not to have not rattled the president. He told journalists in Mpumalanga on Saturday that he was aware of the bubbling tensions. Ramaphosa said he is sympathetic to the challenges faced by ordinary South Africans. He believes the frustration is justified. The President is of the opinion that the government’s interventions will likely quell the tensions. "And as we address the tensions there will be less and less need for reactions like that, so I'm hopeful". Meanwhile, accusations that Ramaphosa was party to covering up a crime at his Phala Phala farm have only made matters worse. But the President said he refuses to be bullied out of office. The threats of a national shutdown come a year after the catastrophic July 2021 civil unrest that the country is yet to recover from. #EskomCrisis | Were at the Tutuka Power Station in Mpumalanga where President Cyril Ramaphosa is conducting an oversight visit amid the countrys worsening electricity crisis. @khanya_mntambo pic.twitter.com/Ia8W9jP4YX  #EskomCrisis | Ramaphosa admits theres a massive crisis at Tutuka but seems upbeat about measures in place to improve the plants efficiency. ~K pic.twitter.com/ueG3xm53Xb
