EAST LONDON - Buffalo City Municipal officials and the Eastern Cape Liquor Board are promising to take swift action against tavern owners who are breaking the law. The decision follows a visit to various taverns in Scenery Park in East London, where 21 young people lost their lives at the Enyobeni Tavern just over a week ago. Some patrons who were at the taverns on Monday during the visit said that they felt that their privacy was being invaded by the officials who were accompanied by law enforcement. Deputy Mayor Princess Faku visited several taverns in Scenery Park on Monday. BCM deputy mayor Princess Faku is visiting 19 taverns in Scenery Park.

"We are coming to look at issues of compliance. Some of these taverns are operating, they have licenses and sometimes they don't comply in terms of the standard of the liquor board," said Faku. Many patrons were not pleased with her presence. But tavern owner, Nothombi Zono, said that she had learnt a lot from the information she received from liquor authorities. "I am very happy with today's visit so that we can see the wrong things that we are doing," said Zono. Residents claim that they're only seeing authorities out in full force now after the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy but the Buffalo City Municipality said that these inspections were conducted every quarter.
