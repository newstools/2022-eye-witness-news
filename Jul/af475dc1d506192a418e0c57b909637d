There’s a slight change to the revenue collector's auto assessment this year. If you agree with the auto-assessment once you've viewed it, you do not need to do anything further - the return will be regarded as submitted and final. If you are not in agreement with the assessment, you can access your tax return via the eFiling site or the SARS MobiApp, complete the return, and file it. This must be done within 40 business days from the date that your assessment was issued to you. For more about the 2022 filing system for individuals, click HERE.
