JOHANNESBURG - Convicted killer Ntuthuko Shoba will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the 2020 murder of his girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule. Acting Judge Stuart Wilson handed down the sentence on Friday. Shoba was found guilty of murdering Pule who was eight months pregnant in June 2020. The 33-year-old former employee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange masterminded Pule’s murder and hired a hitman - Muzikayise Malephane who shot and hanged her body in Durban Deep, in Roodepoort. Malephane is serving a 20-year sentence for the murder after he struck a plea deal with the state. Ntuthuko Shoba sat quietly in the dock dressed in another one of his tailored suits as he prepared to learn his fate. He refused to answer any questions from the media flashing smiles as he caucused with his lawyers. In a concise but scathing judgement, Judge Wilson banished Shoba to life in prison. "For all these reasons Mr Shoba I'm enjoined by the statute to apply the ordinary sentence for a crime of this nature. You will spend the rest of your natural life in prison unless the parol authorities consider you fit for release in the fullness of time". The courtroom erupted in jubilation even before Judge Wilson could exit.
