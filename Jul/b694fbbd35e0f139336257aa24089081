JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police have arrested one suspect in connection with the deadly Katlehong tavern shooting that claimed the lives of two people and left four others wounded. It's understood the suspect was nabbed on Friday.

Police investigations are still continuing in this matter,“ said the police's Dimakatso Sello. The Katlehong shooting is one of several deadly attacks at various taverns across this country.
