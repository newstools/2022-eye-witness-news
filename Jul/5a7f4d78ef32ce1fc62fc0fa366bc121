"While some generation units at other power stations are expected to return to service during the day, these will take time to load up to full capacity. Should there be any further loss of generation capacity during the day or some units fail to return to service as anticipated, load shedding may be required to be implemented at short notice," spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said.
