BEAUFORT WEST - Beaufort West residents said that they feared that municipality would become "captured" under the leadership of Gayton McKenzie. Some community leaders said that they did not trust him and his future plans for the area. The Central Karoo mayor held a 100 day report back event last week and hundreds of residents attended. McKenzie took office at the Central Karoo Local Municipality in April. The Patriotic Alliance (PA) leader had promised to fix potholes, eradicate the bucket system and create jobs. While some welcomed the new mayor and his ideas, others have told Eyewitness News that Beaufort West will be another captured goverment entity. They said that McKenzie was a corrupt person. #BeaufortWest Community leaders Brian Jooste says the area will never become a second Dubai. #Ewn GLS pic.twitter.com/UULpktntWE  But he's denied these claims. "I'm not a corrupt official. How can I be a corrupt official if corruption happens with money. I have not used one cent of this municipality's money. I have never involved myself in anything that is even close to corrupt," he said. The mayor, meanwhile, listed some of the things that he'd achieved in his first 100 days office. The list included a drive to fix the potholes, a local bakery that was opened and through investment, Beaufort West now has its first PPE factory. #BeaufortWest #Jobs #ewn visited the area on Friday one of our stops were a local bread factory in the area.
