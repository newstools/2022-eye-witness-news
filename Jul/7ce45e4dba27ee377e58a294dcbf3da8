Meanwhile, there are expectations for delegates to submit proposals for the party’s contentious step aside resolution to be scrapped. And this is likely to raise temperatures. But, Ramokgopa believes delegates won’t be sidelined by party politics. "The ANC meetings from branch to national are always vibrant because members and stakeholders come from different perspectives and things are not that well in our country, the economy is not at its best although it is recovering, We're just emerging from very harsh COVID-19 pandemic, and unemployment, poverty and all that is still there so members are very robust in their endeavour of trying to deal with the very complex challenges that face the communities and society in general." #ANCPolicyConference ANC deputy President DD Mabuza and acting SG and Treasurer General Paul Mashatile : @AbigailJavier_ pic.twitter.com/DsUefIfWuj
