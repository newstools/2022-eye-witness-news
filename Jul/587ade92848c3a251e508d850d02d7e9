SANDTON - While South Africans have been urged to celebrate the late Nelson Mandela’s birthday with acts of charity and service, some residents in Joburg say the day to remember Madiba and his legacy has been corrupted by those in government. Thousands, if not millions, of people across the world, and particularly in South Africa, spend 67 minutes of their time on Mandela Day to better the community and give back to those in need in honour of South Africa’s founding democratic president, who would have turned 104 this year.

It’s this selfless and unwavering commitment that has seen non-profit organisations like Ladles of Love lead some of the biggest campaigns on Mandela Day to feed the hungry. This year, the NGO has gathered at Nelson Mandela Square in Sandton to build the world’s largest food can mosaic. Those who have donated food cans and volunteered their time say it’s up to society to step into the leadership vacuum left by government. Volunteers said that the greatest contribution we could make today was to emulate the values of Madiba.
