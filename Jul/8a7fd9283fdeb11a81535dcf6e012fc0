Khayalethu Magadla has finally been laid to rest in the Eastern Cape. The body of the six-year-old arrived in Bityi - his father's hometown on Saturday morning. His remains were transported from Gauteng on Friday night. The little boy fell into a manhole in Dlamini, Soweto while playing with friends weeks ago - setting off a major search by city officials. His body washed up at the Eldorado Park wastewater plant nearly three weeks after he went missing. The child's family and relatives were joined by community members at the Magadla homestead to say their final goodbyes. Community members - some from Soweto, where he lived and lost his life were also in attendance. His burial ceremony took place before the actual funeral service, with the little boy's father - Kholekile standing next to his grave watching the coffin designed with cartoon animation as it was lowered to the ground, while his sombre mother sat with families members who were watching the proceedings.
