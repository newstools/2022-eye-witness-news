Hundreds of others were arrested for theft and damage to infrastructure. Board chairperson at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Jakkie Cilliers, said that incapacitated policing units and an inadequate response by intelligence structures were partially to blame for the zero convictions. "It's both of those things. It's very clear that we don't have intelligence. I think you only have to read those various reports from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry to see what goes, as the intelligence community in South Africa doesn't really meet that name," Cilliers said.
