Many workers in Umkomaas said that they were anxious about their futures. Umkomaas, like many small towns in KwaZulu-Natal, largely depends on local small businesses to keep the economy going. Unfortunately, most businesses in the town could not retain their staff members after their premises were ransacked and then set alight. Lungile Ngcobo, who works for a local furniture shop, said that she was one of those affected. "I was at home for four months without an income. The looting had a devastating impact on my life. I struggled to take care of my children and I had to take care of my sisters, who also had their own problems," Ngcobo said. Ngcobo, like many workers in Umkomaas said that she did not believe that they would survive if the country was to experience widescale rioting and looting again.
