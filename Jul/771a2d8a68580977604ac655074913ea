The population of 60.6 million **is** an estimate and it shows that the population is rising, albeit at a very slow rate.  I think the authorities are not really addressing that issue [of the growing youth demographic]... not only in South Africa, but generally in the third world. I see papers by African leaders that talk about 'potential'... the demographic dividend can become a demographic disaster.  Dr Lehohla notes that the number of young people who cannot get jobs is growing. RELATED: SA's new unemployment high: 'Those without strong education left to flounder' With that number of the average age of 28... what is worrying me is that if you take the number of unemployed in the age group 15-34... in 2008 the number of people who were getting jobs was increasing. That ceased to increase by 2018...  ...and it dropped dramatically since 2018 to date. Of course there was COVID, but COVID wasn't the main cause... If you take that ten-year period in absolute numbers, the share of the young people aged 15-34 is the only number that has not only gone stagnant but actually dropped.  If you don't fix the future, you'll sit with a big demographic problem on your hands, concludes Whitfield.
