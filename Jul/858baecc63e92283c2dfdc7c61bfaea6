PRETORIA - There have been further delays in the Senzo Meyiwa trial where five men are appearing for the 2014 murder. The trial resumed on Tuesday for a way forward after the lawyer for the first four accused wrote to the National Prosecuting Authority for the charges against his clients to be dropped. Meyiwa was killed at the home of his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo in Vosloorus on the east rand. After advocate Malesela Teffo abandoned his application on the jurisdiction of the High Court in Pretoria to hear this matter, he brought another matter before the court on a letter from accused number three, Mthobisi Carlos Ncube.

Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela commented on how any advocate should know to share such information with his colleagues before bringing it before the court. He has been eager for this letter to be addressed saying if Ncube were to die in prison, Ncube’s blood would be on his hands. Advocate Baloyi has requested that a correctional services official be present in court before the letter is read so an official response can be made.
