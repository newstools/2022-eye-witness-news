There is no criminal finding against the Deputy Minister of State Security and African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Zizi Kodwa in the state capture commission report. This came from the horse's mouth as the party's National Policy Conference kicked off at the Nasrec Expo Centre on Friday. Kodwa was speaking to Clement Manyathela whose programme was broadcast from the venue. He had testified before state capture commission that the former EOH director Jehan Mackay loaned him over R1 million in 2015. Kodwa also told the commission that he used R850,000 of the money to buy a Jeep. We were in government [when] all this happened, what did we do? What did we not do? And these are the questions that we must ask honestly because the report in itself it does say something about the African National Congress, and you were there and you were the governing party.  Individuals on their own have already taken initiatives, either go to the integrity commission like I have done, others have already made statements that they are reviewing. There are serious findings which have been made about other individuals, at least on my side there is no criminal finding in terms of the commission, so this policy conference it wont be reduced to individuals.
