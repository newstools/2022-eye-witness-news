Gift of the Givers came to their rescue with basic supplies and thanked all partners who assisted with food and other essentials. The organisation's Ali Sably said: “As [Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz] Sooliman always tells us, being a public servant... your work is not in the office. Your work is on the ground.” Father of two Monwabisi Sefa lost everything and hasn't slept in days: “I don't have a place to sleep, I sleep somewhere here and there, with friends sometimes.” Some people have been housed at the local community. Community leaders say they would continue to assist the victims of the fire.
