JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) lost its grip on the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Metro, after a historic multi-party government coalition was signed on Thursday. The agreement was in the making for four months. It will see collaboration between parties, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), the PAC (Pan Africanist Congress), the UDM (United Democratic Movement), and the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus), amongst others. The NMB area has been suffering with a severe water crisis and communities blamed it on the current metro which they say had failed to provide a long-term solution. The coalition parties said negotiations will include common objectives, as well as commitments and solutions, to ensure delivery takes place in the metro. The incoming multi-party coalition government said it plans to curb unemployment and help small businesses. UDM spokesperson Yongama Zigebe has told Eyewitness News that the ANC has given up on the area, signaling a time for change. He said the incoming government is confident in its ability to make an active difference: “Investors have been knocking on our doors and there is no one to answer their calls. The country, and Nelson Mandela Bay where the high rate of unemployment, needs investor and investor confidence in order for us to create a conducive environment for the small business sector.”
