Nearly 200 people gathered at the small white tent set up in the open veld opposite where the brazen shooting took place. The tent is packed, with some forced to stand while singing hymns. Earlier, the family of one of the victims, Nhlonipho Mbanjwa ,performed rituals outside Mdlalose’s Tavern where blood stains can still be seen near the shot-up gate, saying they’d come collect his spirit as they prepare to lay him to rest this weekend.
