Meanwhile, Kholekile lamented the government's absence as they needed assistance with arranging a dignified send-off for his son. He said he’s been hurt by the government he works for during the search for his son, he’s described how he received little help from the Moroka Police Station on the day he went to report his son missing and even during the weeks-long search operation. “Things that I saw during the search hurt me; in front of my eyes, I saw officials sent to swim having to coerce each other. I ended up saying, ‘let me go in myself since you’re pushing each other',” he explained on Friday. Magadla said he wanted his son’s tragic death to underscore the failures of authorities that have failed communities. City officials, including rescuers who worked on the search operation, were among those attending the service on Friday afternoon.
