Sensate focus therapy may be just what you need to ramp up your sex life, according to a sex educator. Sensate focus therapy is a sex therapy technique that uses touching exercises, focusing on the exploration of different sensations while teaching you how to reduce negative thoughts, feelings or anxiety around sexual intimacy. Speaking to Clement Manyathela, sex educator and relationship coach Nu Davidson said people who want to discover how to sexually connect with their partners can also participate in this therapy. It would be done by an individual, and an individual by themselves and as well as integrating it into a relationship.  An estimated nine to fifteen sessions with a professional as what is required to have successful results.
