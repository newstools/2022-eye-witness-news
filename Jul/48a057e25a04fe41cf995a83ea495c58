CAPE TOWN - More than 100 extra traffic and law enforcement officials have hit the streets of Cape Town to keep the peace during power cuts. In Khayelitsha, anti-crime activists are concerned that when the lights go out, residents fall prey to criminals. Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said that they'd pulled out all the stops, as we enter stage four on Wednesday. "We have all our teams on stand-by to assist at any time of the day or night. We've also deployed more than a 100 extra traffic and law enforcement officers to help manage the traffic consequences and to be a visible safety presence in communities at times of load shedding," Hill-Lewis said.
