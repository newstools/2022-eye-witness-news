JOHANNESBURG  - A friend of one of the 16 victims of the Soweto tavern shooting said that he still believes that he could have saved his friend. An injured Luyanda Mjoli was found outside Mdalose’s Tavern in Nomzamo  last Sunday by his friend. A memorial service for the victims was held just meters away from the tavern where friends and families gathered to remember their loved ones. Mjoli's older brother Sithembiso also lost his life in the attack. A memorial service for the 16 victims of the #NomzamoTavern attack is currently underway in Nomzamo Park, Soweto.

Luyanda Mjoli’s friend, Sphumelele Langa, said that he tried to rush him to the hospital after he found him lying outside the tavern but he said when he asked for a lift he was asked to pay. "I also blame myself for Luyanda’s death because if I had money maybe he wouldn’t have died. Luyanda died in front of me," Langa said. Mjoli’s father said that his youngest son didn’t drink and had only been at the tavern for a round of pool with his brother and friend. Meanwhile, while assistance with funeral arrangements has been offered, some families have turned down the offer and will be burying their loved ones this weekend. Counselling services have also been provided. #NomzamoTavern Family members take turns remembering their loved ones who were in the masa shooting.
