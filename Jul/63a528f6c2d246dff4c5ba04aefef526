CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she was ready to “rock and roll” as the parliamentary inquiry into her competence kicked off on Monday. Advocate Dali Mpofu, who is representing Mkhwebane, gave opening remarks in Parliament’s Section 194 inquiry, which held its first day of hearings. The committee also received an opening submission from the inquiry evidence leader. Advocate Mpofu wasted no time in labelling the impeachment process as illegal calling Mkhwebane a fit and proper person. Mpofu told the inquiry that Mkhwebane had been treated unfairly up to this point, but she was ready to fight the inquiry. “We are here. We are ready to rock and roll. We are very ready. But we just want to tell you where you are leading this country and this Parliament, to a bottomless pit and a cesspool of illegality." Mpofu said Mkhwebane’s suspension was also premature: “She gets suspended unlawfully. She has not been able to prepare for this process. Her emails were blocked until last Friday.” Mpofu said they would be back in court later this month to fight Mkhwebane’s suspension. Earlier on Monday morning, committee chairperson Richard Dyantyi called for objectivity. SOME OPPOSITION CALL FOR REINSTATEMENT During Mkhwebane’s impeachment, some parties came to her defence and called for her reinstatement. Mpofu also said Mkhwebane’s suspension by the president was premature and showed clear bias. Some parties represented in the committee have also supported Mpofu’s arguments like UDM leader Bantu Holomisa. “Because the role of the president and the whole issue that has been raised here around the suspension, it makes some of us uncomfortable.” Al Jama-ah MP Ganief Hendricks called on her to be reinstated: "We have an obligation to protect the public protector. So, I call on you chair to ask President Ramaphosa to reinstate the Public Protector, so this Section 194 committee can continue with honour.” The hearings will continue with more submissions on Tuesday.
