JOHANNESBURG - The man arrested for the tavern shooting in Katlehong on the East Rand earlier this month won't be appearing in court on Monday. Two people were killed and four wounded when gunmen stormed the Mputlane Inn Tavern. Police had announced the arrest of a suspect - an EMPD officer - last late week and he was expected to make his first appearance in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Monday. But the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has taken a decision not to enroll the case as they don't feel there's enough evidence.
