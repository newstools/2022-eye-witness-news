JOHANNESBURG - Stormers flank Deon Fourie has been rewarded for his barnstorming performances this season with a new two-year contract extension. Fourie was one of the outstanding players in the Stormers’ victorious United Rugby Championship campaign and claimed the Man of the Match award in the tournament’s final, which was his 100th appearance for the Cape franchise. The 35-year-old’s displays on the field culminated in his selection for the Springbok squad for the three-match Test series against Wales, completing a fairytale season for the hard-working loose forward.
