JOHANNESBURG - Social media platforms are going crazy over Banyana Banyana being crowned the new queens of the continent after they beat hosts Morocco to win a maiden Women’s Africa Cup of Nation title on Saturday, at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium. It was a tightly-contested final but in the end, a brave and clinical display from coach Desiree Ellis’s chargers saw them overcome the intimidating home atmosphere to win the match 2-1. Guys, lets also take a moment to appreciate this lady here, one of the legends of the game. Noko Matlou has been part of the Banyana Banyana setup for as long as I can remember, great servant of the game  #BanyanaBanyana #Banyana #WAFCON2022 pic.twitter.com/j8q60bMRSl  The champions will touchdown back in South Africa on Tuesday, 26 July with the trophy and gold medals. It was Banyana's sixth attempt, as they have been denied in five previous Women's Afcon finals – 1995, 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018.
