CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Transport officials and police are trying to intervene at a taxi protest in Stellenbosch. It's understood taxi drivers on Monday blocked several roads. It's unclear what the protest is about but it comes shortly after an operator was arrested for outstanding warrants. "Law enforcement and traffic officers have been assisting the SAPS in addressing the illegal taxi strike at several key intersections in the Stellenbosch area.  We have also been in contact with taxi associations who have requested that their members hold this illegal demonstration. Intersections are opening up, but traffic is quite heavy in the area and do advise that residents stay clear of the area if at all possible,” said Stellenbosch Municipality spokesperson, Stuart Grobbelaar. Motorists in the Cape are being urged to avoid main roads in #Stellenbosch, as traffic officials and police attend to an illegal taxi strike.Some roads have since been reopened, but officials are still urging drivers to be cautious. -SPJ pic.twitter.com/SQWxInwW9G
