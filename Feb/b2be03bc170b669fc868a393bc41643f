CAPE TOWN - A woman's been arrested in a drug bust at Cape Town International Airport. She was  approached by police and customs officials on Tuesday who searched her luggage and shoes. They came across nearly three kilograms of cocaine and a stash of heroin worth R870,000. She was traveling from Brazil to South Africa via Qatar. The suspect is expected in court on Thursday. In a separate bust, in the Uniondale area on Tuesday, police manning a roadblock noticed a car wanted to do a U-turn.
