JOHANNESBURG - The City of Tshwane on Wednesday said that it would continue turning off power at businesses and government departments until they paid up. It's trying to claw back outstanding money. Forest Hill Mall paid R4 million to avoid disconnection. If you owe us, please make payment arrangements  before we switch you off. #TshwaneYaTima #CoTRevenueCollection pic.twitter.com/reIAvxkk1k  After much resistance, and intimidation, we finally switched off Denel! We treat all our customers the same without fear or favour. #TshwaneYaTima #CoTRevenueCollection pic.twitter.com/b8tTZrM0pV  The big culprits of the day  Department of Investructure Development (owing us R245 million), and Department of Public Works ( owing us R110 million). #TshwaneYaTima #CoTRevenueCollection pic.twitter.com/md8tgwtpbX  The landlord who owns the building that houses the SANDF Navy has paid. Busy reconnecting. #TshwaneYaTima #CoTRevenueCollection https://t.co/WGIuwNLgsh  The city is owed around R17 billion in rates, power and other services. A local hotel, Denel and the Water and Sanitation Department have seen their electricity cut, with defaulting residents to follow. The municipality's Sipho Stuurman said: “We are on a mission to collect these funds that are owed to us and basically maintain that this is not a publicity stunt. We are serious regarding this matter, we mean business and we intend to go after all our debtors because they cannot continue to consume our services for free.”
