DURBAN - Disbanded Mkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans Association's former spokesperson Carl Niehaus's COVID-19 contravention trial has been postponed to May. Niehaus was arrested while doing a live television interview in July 2021 outside the Estcourt Correctional facility where former President Jacob Zuma was jailed, and while he was surrounded by other supporters. The gathering was in contravention of the lockdown regulations at the time. Friday was the second day for the trial at the Estcourt Magistrates Court. One of the police officers who arrested Niehaus then took to the stand but the matter was postponed for further evidence. "The State has led two of its witnesses as well as video footage as part of the evidence. The matter was further postponed to 16 and 17 May 2022 for further evidence in the State's case," said NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara.

However, he said his instruction was not adhered to: "That's when I informed the brigadier that Niehaus was warned not to address anyone. I asked the brigadier and the colonel to accompany me to effect the arrest." But Niehaus said the State had no case against him, claiming his arrest was a political plot. He alleges that it was being driven by someone or some people with a political agenda against him. He said the State had not been able to present a strong case in this matter. "I am more than ever convinced that these are trumped-up charges and that I've not committed any crime." He still blames the current ANC leadership and government, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, for his arrest.
