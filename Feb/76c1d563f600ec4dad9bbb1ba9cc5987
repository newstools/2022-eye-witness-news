It added that over the coming weeks, respective ministers would be unpacking government's programme of action for the year. Despite the audibly less enthusiastic clapping when the president spoke of state capture, Cabinet said it firmly supported the process that would see the implementation of the commission's recommendations. Meanwhile, this week a 30-year-old nurse at the Tembisa Hospital was shot dead allegedly by her police officer boyfriend which sparked widespread outrage. Ramaphosa recently signed into law three acts to fight gender-based violence and femicide that Cabinet said was a major advance to defeat the scourge.
