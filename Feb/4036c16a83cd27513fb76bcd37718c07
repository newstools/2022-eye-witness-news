The Special Tribunal has set aside contracts by the Gauteng Education Department to decontaminate schools and ordered all service providers who received payment to pay back the money. Last year, hundreds of companies that appeared to have had no expertise or prior experience in the cleaning industry benefitted from the R431 million projects. The tribunal found that the department did not follow proper procurement processes. Special Investigating Unit (SIU) spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago explained how the money would be paid back to the Education Department. "The tribunal indicated that they must give their statements and accounts so that we are able to see what their cost and what their profit was and then we calculate and then we only require from them the profit that they've made," Kganyago said. Kganyago said that the work done so far would be taken into account. "Now that the contract is unlawful, we can not disadvantage them if they've had the costs of buying the material and all of that. We're only going to subtract the costs as they bought them and then any profit they've made, we want ti back because this contract was entered into in an unlawful manner," he said.
