JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said there were no specific conditions attached to the R11 billion World Bank loan secured by South Africa. Godongwana and his team have answered questions from MPs on Tuesday about the loan before Parliament's Standing Committee of Finance. Treasury explained that the money comes from the World Bank's development policy loan product and that the country, by its response to COVID-19 and social-economic programmes, qualified for it. But the Economic Freedom Fighters' Floyd Shivambu doesn't see the rationale. "There is no rationality that has been given now as to why we have been given a loan from the World Bank, except that we are eligible for a loan, therefore, we must take it. What kind of logic is that? Because I'm eligible for a loan, I must take it?" Godongwana appealed to MPs not to reject the loan, saying it would be detrimental to his department's work. "You may disagree with us, you are entitled to your opinion, but rationale is there. The next set of issues is, should the committee reject this, it will be detrimental to the work we are doing." CONCERNS Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance said it was concerned about the current debt service costs following the R11 billion World Bank loan. The bank has listed the interest rate at 0.8%. The country spends R270 billion annually to service debt, which is the third biggest expenditure item, following education and social services. Committee Chairperson Joe Maswanganyi has reiterated the committee's long-held position that high debt often comes with a detrimental effect on service delivery. He said it was concerning that health and community development were the fourth and fifth national expenditure items respectively.
