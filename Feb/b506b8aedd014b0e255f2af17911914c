JOAHNNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa is back before Parliament at the Cape Town City Hall on Wednesday to respond to the two-day debate into his State of the Nation Address (Sona). Ramaphosa is addressing a number of issues and responding to his critics, who dismissed his speech as being as being a rehash and weak on solutions. He delivered his address last week Thursday.
