JOHANNESBURG - A witness in the Tshegofatso Pule murder case has told the court that Ntuthuko Shoba withheld one of his cellphones while being questioned by police. Shoba is the accused mastermind behind his girlfriend's murder in 2020 and he was heavily implicated by the man convicted of Pule's murderer. Sergeant Mpe Teme told the court that when he initially called Shoba in for questioning, he willingly gave his phone over to police, which they searched. But Teme said when he later went to arrest Shoba, he  learned that there was a second phone. "The reason for taking his cellphone from him was to assist us with the docket that was already opened for murder and he also agreed with assisting us." The second phone discovered by police is where WhatsApp messages between Pule and Shoba were found. Sergeant Teme said from those messages, it was clear that the couple were having a fight. SIM SWAP Teme also told the court that Shoba did a sim swap after handing his phone over without the permission or the knowledge of the police. Shoba’s lawyer said his client told him that police gave him permission to do a sim swap. But Teme denies this: “He didn’t ask for permission from anyone, we realised that he did a sim swap when the phone was no longer receiving messages.” Shoba's second phone was found by police upon his arrest and the contents of that device have been used as evidence against him. The matter will resume on Thursday.
