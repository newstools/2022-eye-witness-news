JOHANNESBURG - Police have used rubber bullets to disperse some parents and pupils at Hoërskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. Tensions ran high outside the high school on Monday morning over allegations of racism at the school. Parents have accused government of ignoring their complaints following a fight, allegedly between black and white pupils on Friday. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is currently at the school – he attempted to intervene but was interrupted by angry parents. "I want to assure you as parents that are here, I appreciate your presence. All of you, I appreciate your concerns," Lesufi said. After a brief standoff between the parents, Lesufi addressed the crowd where he promised that the department would investigate racism allegations. "This country belongs to all of us and we are not going to be treated as step-children in our schools and we are not doing anyone any favours by enrolling our children in all this things," he said.
