JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Police Commissioner Elias Mawela on Friday said there had been a 4.5% drop in contact crimes and an 18.3% increase in murder. Rape cases have dropped by 7.4%. Mawela is presenting the province’s third quarterly crime stats to the legislature’s portfolio committee on community safety. He said the reduction in gender-based violence cases could be attributed to partnerships with communities and NGOs, awareness campaigns, suspect tracing operations coupled with court convictions. "This is a clear indication of a negative social behaviour of resolving disputes with violence.”
