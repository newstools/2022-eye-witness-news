JOHANNESBURG - Search and rescue operations are underway for three people who went missing after heavy rains in Midstream near Olifantsfontein. Overnight fire and emergency officials managed to rescue four people in a car in the flooded Old Pretoria Road. Several parts of Gauteng, including Mamelodi, Centurion and Midstream have flooded after heavy downpours overnight. Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Services’ William Ntladi asked residents to be cautious and stay away from low lying areas or large pools of water. #TshwaneFloods in 2019 left hundreds of Eerste Fabriek residents without homes. They say since then, only few families were moved. Some here say they will wait for the water to subside,to save their property, before they consider moving to temporary shelters.

Tshwane Emergency Services’ Charles Mabaso said response teams were on the ground in several areas. “The areas most affected at the moment are where our teams are on the ground conducting assessments and have been intervening since [Friday] night.” In Mamelodi, rescue operations in the Eerste Fabriek Informal Settlement proved to be a challenge – 60 homes were identified as being in imminent danger. Some residents took refuge on rooftops after raging waters entered their homes when the Pienaarsrivier burst its banks. Mabaso said some people, who refused to be evacuated, chased rescue teams away. Authorities were on standby as community leaders engaged disgruntled residents. Community leader Prince Leshiba said they were angry because they wanted a permanent solution for residents who were affected by floods every year. Rescue officials remain on high alert in the area with temporary accommodation organised for those in need.
