JOHANNESBURG - The City of  Tshwane is revoking services to customers whose accounts have been in arrears for more than three months. In a statement, the city said that its aggressive and unprecedented revenue collection campaign was aimed at clawing back some of the R17 billion sitting on its debtor's book by cutting off electricity and water. The main culprits are government departments, embassies, businesses and residential customers. The city said that the staggering debt was making it difficult for Tshwane to fulfil its obligation of delivering essential and basic services to its residents and customers. @CityTshwane embarks on aggressive revenue collection campaign by disconnecting services to defaulting customers. #CoTRevenueCollection pic.twitter.com/0q43mwJ0Nn
