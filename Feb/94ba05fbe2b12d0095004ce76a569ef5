CAPE TOWN - The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) said granting Eskom an electricity tariff hike was a balancing act between the economy, consumers, as well as the utility's interests. Nersa announced a 9.61% electricity tariff hike on Thursday. However, Eskom had sought an electricity tariff hike of 20.5%.

The announced tariff hike increase, whilst still high, is better than the 20.5% requested by Eskom.” Gumede stressed the actual tariff increase was below inflation. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters have rejected Nersa's approval of the increase, describing the tariff hike as an "anti-poor decision". Party Spokesperson Leigh-Ann Mathys said: “This is context of depressive levels of unemployment, a dwindling economy, and unprecedented increases to the cost of living. Any increase to the cost of electricity is a cruel addition to the disarray of the poor.”
