Mafe faces charges of housebreaking with the intent to commit arson and terrorism, theft, arson as well as a separate terrorism charge. The Cape Town Magistrate’s Court had referred him for psychiatric observation following his arrest. His defence took issue with this and went to the Western Cape High Court, which ruled that the decision to have him admitted to the Valkenbeg Psychiatric Facility was unlawful. He had to be discharged and sent back to prison. Mafe's bail bid was meant to be heard a week ago but he contracted COVID-19 and the matter had to be postponed.
