Urgent action is needed from the government and the South African Police Service.” Khasa says while sexual offences declined by 9 percentage compared to the same quarter the previous year 11,315 people were raped in three months. “The fact that over 5 000 of the rape incidents took place at the home of the victim or the home of the perpetrator indicate we still have a long way to go to deal with this issue as a country.
