That conversation never took place,” he told the court. He was also asked if he wanted Pule dead because her pregnancy posed a threat to his relationship. During his testimony, Malephane said that Shoba told him that he was going to benefit from an R8 million life cover policy after his fiancé’s mother passed away. “It’s none of his business. He’s not someone I would confide in about my private affairs. I don’t think he knew any of them anyway,” he added. Shoba told the court he was excited to be a father, even naming the child Ntombikayise, which means “father's little girl”.
