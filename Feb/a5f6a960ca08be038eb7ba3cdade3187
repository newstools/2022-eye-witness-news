JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has announced that load shedding will be reduced from stage 2 to stage 1 from 9 pm on Friday. The country has been subjected to power cuts since Wednesday this week. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the power utility said load shedding would last until Monday as initially planned. "While there has been an improvement in the generation capacity, and a significant recovery in the emergency generation reserves, caution is still called for as this is not sufficient to suspend load sheddingat this point." Eskom is still calling on consumers to use power sparingly. "We will communicate promptly should there be any significant changes to the power system."
