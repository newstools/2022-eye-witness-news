UKRAINE - A United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Russia has been listed for an emergency meeting on Friday. The proposal, however, was expected to be vetoed by Moscow. It comes amid worldwide condemnation against Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Blasts were heard early on Friday morning in the capital city, Kiev, which officials said could be cruise or ballistic missiles. China is the one major power that has refused to condemn Moscow, instead repeating calls for parties to "exercise restraint" and accusing the US of "fueling fire" in the tensions. Meanwhile, the White House has condemned Moscow over what it said were “credible reports” that civilian staff of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine had been taken hostage.
