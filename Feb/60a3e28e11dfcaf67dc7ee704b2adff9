President Ramaphosa said that a review of the Business Act and other laws affecting small, medium and micro-enterprises was underway. "There are too many regulations in this country that are unduly complicated, costly and difficult to comply with. This prevents companies from growing and creating jobs," he said. Business leader Sipho Nkosi will head a team in the Presidency focused on cutting red tape. "The red tape team will identify priority reforms for the year ahead, including mechanisms to ensure government departments pay suppliers within the required 30 days. The team will also work with other departments and agencies to unblock specific obstacles to investment and business growth. It will support current initiatives to simplify processes relating to property registration, cross-border trade and construction permits,” President Ramaphosa said. A new “bounce-back” programme will replace the failed loan-guarantee scheme, making it easier for companies to qualify but the details will come later.
