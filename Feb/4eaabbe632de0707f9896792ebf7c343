JOHANNESBURG - National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula on Wednesday turned down the African Transformation Movement (ATM)'s request to have the vote of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa via secret ballot. Mapisa-Nqakula said she wouldn't be able to grant them their request when the vote of no confidence was yet to be considered. ATM lost a bid in the Supreme Court of Appeal last year, which set aside another court verdict of former Speaker Thandi Modise's decision declining the party's motion to vote through a secret ballot. Mapisa-Nqakula said she would request Parliament's schedule committee to hold the motion once due consultations had been finalised. ATM said under Ramaphosa, the country had a dismal economic outlook and therefore he should be moved as the president of the country.
