This is detailed in the second instalment of the Zondo Commission’s report, which focuses on Denel and Transnet. The report has made scathing findings against Brown, placing her at the centre of capture at Denel.

It further states that momentum for the joint venture appears to have built after Brown appointed a new board, retaining only one member Johannes Motseki. Motseki was found to be a Gupta business partner who was allocated shares in Gupta-led consortium to buy a mining company. The report further notes how Denel’s financial problems coincided with changes made by Brown. Denel is currently not looking for a bailout but will dispose of non-core assets and enter strategic partnerships.
