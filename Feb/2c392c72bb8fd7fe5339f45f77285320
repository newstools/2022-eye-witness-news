Minister Gungubele was at Cape Town International Airport on Wednesday night and was excited to be part of the team dressed in green. "I'm very excited to be part of the team. People move in South Africa. They go to informal settlements and so on. For socio-economic challenges, it will have bearing, whether it is access to sanitation and water..." the minister said. Speaking about the protection of personal information, Stats SA's Trevor Oosterwyk said that information would not be made available to entities - not to the South African Revenue Service or ministers. "Once we've collected that data, it goes into machinery that processes the data and anonymises it. That means that from the data you cannot identify individual people. You can only identify numbers," Oosterwyk said. He said that this was the fourth census and no information gathered during these processes had ever been leaked.
