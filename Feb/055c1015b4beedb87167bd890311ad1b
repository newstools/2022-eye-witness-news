JOHANNESBURG – DStv on Tuesday announced that as of 22 March this year, it would be limiting the streaming of its services on its DStv Now app to only one account in an effort to clamp down on mass password sharing and piracy. The MultiChoice-owned broadcast satellite service announced that this change will happen to all subscriptions throughout Africa. “From 22 March 2022, customers will be limited to streaming DStv on one device at a time. They will still be able to watch previously downloaded content on a second device,” the broadcast group said in a statement. According to MultiChoice, they will not be limiting the number of people who can login in but are only limiting services to one concurrent stream. “The change will be made to all DStv subscriptions across Africa; however, only customers making use of more than one concurrent stream will be directly affected by the change," MultiChoice said. DStv packages are set to increase in April this year, with the cheapest viewer package going for R29 and offering 36 channels and the premium package for over R800 for over 150 channels. DSTV has scored an own goal. Watch how IPTV will exponentially grow now considering it has all DSTV channels, Netflix movies, series and basically almost all tv channels from around the globe at around R200/pm or at a once off fee of R1,050.00/pa.Once people know IPTV,ziyakhala!  DStv dont get it. These people watching on extra devices are all your viewers. You need viewers above everything else. If people find other alternatives, its only a matter of time till the rest try those alternatives too. Especially cheaper alternatives.  Lets face it we only have DStv for Supersport
