CAPE TOWN - Eskom has had to suspend services in a Dutywa community in the Eastern Cape. A team of workers was threatened, and their vehicle was vandalised by protesting residents earlier this week. They were trying to repair a damaged power line, when the mob confronted them and demanded they attend to illegal electricity connections in another area. The utility's now withdrawn services there until tensions die down.
