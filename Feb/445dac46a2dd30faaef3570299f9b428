JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has called for harsh action to be taken against a school minibus driver following a crash in which  two children were killed. The driver lost control of the vehicle and rammed into a truck in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. Some eyewitnesses on the scene say the minibus driver was visibly drunk - however this has not been confirmed. While no parent expects their child to go to school and never return - this was the case for two KwaZulu-Natal families. The pupils were on their way home from school when the school transport vehicle they were travelling in lost control and rammed into a truck. Two school children were declared dead on the scene and six sustained serious injuries and were taken to nearby hospitals for medical attention. " The driver has been arrested and will be appearing in court on Monday, and we wish a speedy recovery to those learners that are still being treated in hospital" said MEC Kwazi Mshengu. Mshengu also sent his condolences to the bereaved families.
