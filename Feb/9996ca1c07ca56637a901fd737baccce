The question is whether we can afford a basic income grant depending again on the level we need to peg it," Minister Godongwana said. The president in his State of the Nation Address on Thursday night announced that the relief grant would be paid out for another year. The finance minister would not commit to any timeframes on when the basic income grant would be implemented, if at all. "Not in the next two years," the minister said.
