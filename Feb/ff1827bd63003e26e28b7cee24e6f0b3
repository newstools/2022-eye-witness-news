"She also wanted to know can someone just take her to Smit, which shows me she did not come to terms, really, she wants to ask him what he did to her child," Bains said. The boy was laid to rest in the West Coast town on Saturday where scores of relatives, friends and community members gathered at the Klawer Community Hall to bid Jerobejin a final farewell. Daniel Smit, who's been arrested for the youngster's killing, returns to court in April.
