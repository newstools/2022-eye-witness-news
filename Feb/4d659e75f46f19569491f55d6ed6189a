The company has recently completed the first step in reproducing a replica of Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Tedros Ghebreyesus is optimistic about the success of the project. "The only option we have is to succeed. We have already identified some of the challenges," he said. WHO chief scientist, Doctor Soumaya Swaminathan, has lauded the brisk pace scientists are working. "This is a testament to the scientific capability in Africa and South Africa that this has happened so quickly and we are very confident, all the partners on board, that this can be expanded," she said.
