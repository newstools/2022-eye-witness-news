Both police and community members agreed to the further training of officers and of young male community members to prevent instances of GBV. The police's Novela Potelwa said, “In some of these cases, it’s something that happens behind closed doors where police would not know about it but obviously there is a neighbour who knows something. Do not keep quiet when you see wrongdoing, you need to know what you can do as a responsible citizen to ensure we deal with the scourge of gender-based violence and femicide.”
