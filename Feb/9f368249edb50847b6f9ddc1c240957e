Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela said this is a very important moment in history. " The nomination of the Supreme Court President Mandisa Maya to be considered by the President as Chief Justice is a historic development in South Africa. As we await the finality of things we should take into account that it's the prerogative of the President to nominate someone and then the President consults parties".
