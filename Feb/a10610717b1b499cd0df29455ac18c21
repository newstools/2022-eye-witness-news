The State had argued that releasing Mafe on bail could endanger the public and undermine peace and security. They also said he posed a significant flight risk. Prosecutor Advocate Mervyn Menigo pointed to “substantial allegations” that Mafe purchased petrol in a bottle, before making his way to Parliament. He alleged that after spending some time inside, the accused used boxes, paper and the petrol to set the building alight. Defence attorney Luvuyo Godla said they accepted the court’s decision in the High court. Mafe will remain in custody at Pollsmoor Prison until his next court appearance on 11 February.
