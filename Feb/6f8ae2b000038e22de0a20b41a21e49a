JOHANNESBURG - An Eskom employee has been handcuffed for allegedly stealing transformer oil and power safety solvent gel. In a statement, the utility said that the worker was busted on Thursday by security personnel while trying to leave its Rosherville premises with three full drums of the oil and six 5-litre containers of gel. He appeared in court on Monday and would also undergo a disciplinary hearing. Eskom said that it was committed to curbing all electricity-related criminal activity, including crimes involving its own employees. Eskom has asked everyone in South Africa to report any tampering or theft.
