A police investigation led to the arrest of 28-year-old Bridget Bojosi days later. Police spokesperson, Adele Myburgh, said: “Bones and clothes were found in January 2020. Although the mother confirmed they were the clothes of the missing boy, the bones were sent to a forensic laboratory for testing and they came back positive. Consequent to the findings, the reward has been withdrawn. A murder and kidnapping case is under investigation.” Bojosi has been remanded in custody and is expected back in court in August.
