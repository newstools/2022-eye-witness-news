JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse has asked for 14 days to respond to demands by the Soweto community. Protesters submitted a memorandum of demands to Phalatse outside the civic centre in Braamfontein on Tuesday afternoon. Residents want Phalatse to commit to better service delivery and to find a solution to the impasse with Eskom on electricity tariffs. It’s been long day that has culminated in a mutual agreement between disgruntled residents and Joburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse. A charged  crowd detailed their grievances - the electricity crisis being top of the list. They also blame the abundant informal settlements for a rise in crime. Before giving Phalatse room for a brief address where she vowed to put heads together on a tangible solution to a myriad of community issues. "After 14 days we will call your leadership and give them a progress report on how the talks went and what the turn around plan is".
