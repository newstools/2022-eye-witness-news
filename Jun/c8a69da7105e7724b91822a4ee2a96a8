With the winter cold now settling in, many persons turn to open flame fires for warmth. With an increase of residential and informal settlement fires increasing at a rate of around 10% each year, we implore all residents to exercise extreme caution this winter.  Never leave an open flame fire unattended and always ensure any fires are made away from surrounding materials that could easily ignite.
