JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency says it's aware of former spy boss Arthur Fraser’s criminal complaint against President Cyril Ramaphosa but adds there is no basis for the claims. In a statement, the presidency said it “can confirm that a robbery took place at the president’s farm in Limpopo on or around 9 February 2020 in which proceeds from the sale of game were stolen. “ Fraser on Wednesday laid a criminal complaint against Ramaphosa, accusing him of breaching the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Fraser further alleges that the suspects were kidnapped, interrogated and paid off to keep silent. President @CyrilRamaphosa was chairing a cabinet meeting until late in the evening yesterday. He has been informed about the Arthur Fraser statement. The Presidency will communicate in due course.
