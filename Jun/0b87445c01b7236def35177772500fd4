JOHANNESBURG - Power utility Eskom will implement stage 6 power cuts from 2pm on Thursday until midnight, adding that it would also implement stage 6 blackouts on Friday from 5am until midnight. The rolling blackouts will continue into the weekend, Eskom said, at a minimum of stage 4. It said that this was due to the continued unprotected strike at some of its power stations.

Union members, who work in a designated essential service, have a legal and moral obligation to return to work in order to safeguard South Africa from further load shedding," the utility said in a statement. Wage talks between unions and Eskom collapsed last week after the power utility offered workers 5.3%. The utility on Tuesday night then tabled a 7% offer, which unions are consulting their members about.
