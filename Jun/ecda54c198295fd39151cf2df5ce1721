JOHANNESBURG - Stats SA said eight industries recorded positive growth in the first quarter of the year. Manufacturing led the pack with a 4.9% increase. The latest data released on Tuesday - show that the economy grew by 1.9% between January and March. The economic growth returned to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels – showing that the pressures felt over the past two years were beginning to ease. Meanwhile, finance, real estate, business services and trade - also made meaningful contributions to the growth. "Manufacturing contributed 0.6 percentage point while it grew at 4.9%. It was followed by trade as well as by finance both which contributed 0.4 percentage point each while they grew at 3.1 as well as 1.7% respectively," said Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke.   Furthermore, Stats SA said mining which has been one of the leaders in terms of the country’s economic performance contracted in the first quarter of the year. This was due to lower output in platinum group metals, iron ore, and gold. Earlier the national statistics body announced that GDP had grown by 1.9% – returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. In 2021, the mining industry’s direct contribution to GDP grew by 36% to R481 billion. Along with manufacturing, mining made major contributions to the country’s GDP during the bleak years of the pandemic. However, there was a downside in the industry over the first three months of 2022 – with mining and quarrying decreasing by 1.1%. "So even though we still had very high commodity prices in the first quarter, you still need to be able to produce more in order to gain off the economic activity - which is why mining production in the country needs to contract as a contribution," said Citibank Economist Gina Schoeman. Meanwhile, construction also remained one of the most concerning sectors in the economy declining for a fourth consecutive quarter.
