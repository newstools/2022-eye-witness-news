ANC regional leaders said that they wanted the party in the province to fix its problems. The party lost major ground in the previous local government elections and there are concerns about the next general election. Harry Gwala regional chairperson Zamo Nxumalo said: “Former President Jacob Zuma was part and parcel of the ANC to claim its ground post-1994, and since now, we’ve lost the ground a little bit. We came to him to ask what they were doing.” He said Zuma gave them what they wanted: “We have got the wisdom we wanted but we won’t share it because we have political competition with other parties.” The regional leaders want to go to the upcoming party conference as a united ANC.
