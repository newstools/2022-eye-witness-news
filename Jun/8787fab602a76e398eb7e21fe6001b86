JOHANNESBURG - ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe has called on South Africans to allow the South African Revenue of Services (SARS) and the reserve bank space to do their job – he said action over the Phala Phala farm saga will be taken depending on evidence of wrongdoing. Mantashe was speaking at the sidelines of the Gauteng provincial conference in Benoni – shortly after delivering the opening address. Eyewitness News understands he brushed off attempts to bring up the issue at the ANC’s special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Thursday evening. A criminal complaint has been laid against President Cyril Ramaphosa by former spy boss Arthur Fraser – who’s accused him of attempting to cover up the crime. Mantashe said if the money was in the wrong place at the wrong time – let that be dealt with by the correct authorities: “Therefore SARS must deal with that issue and the reserve bank must deal with exchange controls and we will follow in the outcome of that process - then take action. In South Africa that is not what is followed, what is expected in South Africa is Phala Phala – therefore fire everybody.’’
