JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new dawn dream has been haunted by the crime and corruption allegations against him, when the former head of the South African State Security Agency, Arthur Fraser, filed a criminal complaint against the president earlier this month. Fraser accused Ramaphosa of kidnapping, bribery, money laundering and concealing a crime related to the alleged theft of $4m from his Phala Phala farm, in a 12-page sworn statement, accompanied by photographs, documents and closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the alleged theft taking place. Following these allegations, President Cyril Ramaphosa issued a statement admitting to the robbery on his farm on 9 February 2020 but denied any criminal conduct. President Ramaphosa is clear that there is no basis for the claims of criminal conduct that have been made against him in Mr Frasers statement.  But what are the political, ethical and legal implications of these allegations against the president? Political economist and activist Dr Dale McKinley, political analyst Dr Sithembile Mbete and Fin24 writer, Carol Paton, joined Eyewitness News senior political reporter, Theto Mahlakona, to discuss the political, ethical and legal implications that cloud the president.
