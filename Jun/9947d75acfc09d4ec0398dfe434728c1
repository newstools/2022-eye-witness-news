"I don't know what's happening. I still want to know what's happening," he said. Cele addressed the media following his visit to the family. "With all the efforts we've done, we continue to do them to find out what happened by getting somebody or some people that have caused this trouble. It does look like it was not an accident that our member died, it looks like it was planned or somebody wanted it to happen," Cele said. Twenty-seven police officers have been killed in the first three months of this year.
