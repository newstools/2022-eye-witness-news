Group CEO Brett Botten warned that inflationary pressures will continue to persist, with the consumer expected to remain under pressure. He said a large number of stores are preparing to launch the new online shopping platform SPAR2U. Bruce Whitfield asks Botten about Spar SA's big move into home delivery. We have been in online for a number of years, but disparate and fragmented... with some primitive, and some fairly sophisticated solutions... but all in independent stores driven by the owners...  We realised obviously with what's happened through COVID and the rapid rise of on demand shopping that we need to be in the space.  We embarked on a journey last year to build a platform... SPAR2U... obviously with complexity in our model because of the independent retailer and the fact that we wanted to build a 'shared value ecosystem' and not bypass our retailers to get to the ultimate consumer...  The platform has been tested in Gauteng and Spar is ready to start the scale-out rapidly, Botten says. They're on track to have "a fair number" of stores offering the SPAR2U app by the end of 2022. We think we've built something really special because of our community slant - your favourite Spar now online - which is different from a corporate outfit.
