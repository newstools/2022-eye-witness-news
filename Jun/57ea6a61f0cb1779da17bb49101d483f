JOHANNESBURG - The community of Dlamini Soweto on Friday gathered to support the emergency services and team who have been searching for 6-year-old Khaya Magadla. The six-year-old from Dlamini, Soweto, fell into an open manhole on Sunday while playing with friends. Residents, school children and family members gathered – singing together – hoping that the boy will be found. Emergency spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said they would look for him – until he is found. "In the areas that we cannot physically send technicians, we are going to send a robot and we are hoping that maybe by today." Search and rescue operations have so far revealed no sign of the child, with the search set to continue on Saturday.
