BAKU - World champion Max Verstappen led a Red Bull1-2 in Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix in a potentially key moment of the title race after Charles Leclerc and Ferrari endured another dose of race-day misery. Sergio Perez had jumped pole sitter Leclerc to the first turn before Verstappen took control as first the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz and then Leclerc retired with engine problems. Verstappen's fifth win of the season tightened his grip on the drivers' standings with Perez now moving into secondahead of the pointless Leclerc.
