EAST LONDON - Various church organisations have held a prayer session outside the Enyobeni Tavern in the Eastern Cape on Thursday. The churches have paid tribute to the 21 teenagers who died at the venue on Sunday. People have also laid wreaths outside the establishment, singing church hymns and praying to comfort the families of the victims. The Methodist Church of Southern Africa and other congregations are in attendance while police cordoned off the area as more forensic teams are on the ground. And as this prayer session concludes the families are still left with many questions. But, the church members who gathered outside the tavern have prayed that such never happens again. Church leaders in Scenery Park have called on taverns and other liquor outlets to stop selling alcohol to children. Methodist church's Reverend Mbuyiseni Shabalala is one of those who led his congregation there. "We know that they are making profit but not at the expense of the life of people; the people who were there, were young people. So, it is very important that when you sell, don't sell alcohol to young people, more especially those who are under 18."
