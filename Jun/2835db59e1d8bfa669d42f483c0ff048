The Health Department on Monday reported three cases in Tshwane and one on the West Rand. The NICD is urging parents and caregivers to ensure that their children’s vaccinations are up to date. Public health surveillance and response head, Michelle Groome, said: “Non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing and hand washing might not be sufficient to prevent transmission of measles virus.
