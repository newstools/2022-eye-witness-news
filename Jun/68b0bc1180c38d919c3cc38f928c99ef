It's appealed to South Africans to help limit the impact by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. On Monday, the power utility was without more than 5,200 megawatts due to planned maintenance while another 14,200 megawatts were unavailable due to breakdowns. Eskom has reiterated that the power cuts were implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid and said that officials would continue to monitor the system closely.
