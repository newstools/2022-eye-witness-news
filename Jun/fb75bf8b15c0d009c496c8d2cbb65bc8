The utility said that was necessary to boost emergency generation reserves to react to unforeseen circumstances as well as to replenish emergency reserves to prepare for the weekend. It said that this would "help fill the generation deficit while dealing with generating units that may trip amidst the disturbances and compensate for the inability to return generating units timeously to service". Eskom said that the stage four power cuts would start at 11am until midnight on Friday and continue from 5am on Saturday and Sunday and continue until midnight on both days. #POWERALERT1To conserve emergency generation reserves, loadshedding will be implemented to Stage 4 from 11:00 am until midnight tonight. pic.twitter.com/IHv6sLVuqt
