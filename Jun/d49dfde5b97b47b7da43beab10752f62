CAPE TOWN - Police have recovered stolen Eskom cables worth an estimated R2.5 million that went missing after a truck that was transporting the power utility’s electrical overhead cables was high-jacked in Piketberg last month. The suspected cable thieves were tracked down in Cape Town and detectives traced the stolen cables at a storage facility in Blackheath. South African Police Service spokesperson, Ndakhe Qwala, said detectives pounced on the facility earlier on Monday and arrested eight suspects. "Six rows of aluminium cables were seized. Eight suspects were aged between  29 and 49. And were arrested for the possession of stolen goods, contravention of the second-hand goods act and contravening [the] infrastructure criminal amendment act". The suspects will appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.
