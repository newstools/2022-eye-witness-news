Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said that a generation unit each at the Kendal and Matimba power stations, as well as two units at the Matla power station, broke down on Wednesday morning. "This reduced generation capacity by 2,400MW, adding to the ongoing capacity constraints. There has been a delay in returning to service a unit at Kusile power station, which is now expected to return to service tomorrow. We currently have 3,630MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,277MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns," Mantshantsha said.
