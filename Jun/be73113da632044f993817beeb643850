JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for the sacking of mineral resources minister Gwede Mantashe over the country's energy crisis. The party said the threat of stage 6 load shedding highlights the failures of the governing African National Congress (ANC) and, in particular, a string of energy ministers and Eskom war rooms led by President Cyril Ramaphosa first and later by deputy president David Mabuza. "The ongoing silence by Ramaphosa, Gwede Mantashe and Pravin Gordhan is proof that they are little more than bystanders in a crisis of their own making. "In our call to Cabinet for a State of Disaster to be declared on Eskom and the electricity sector, we cautioned that South Africa’s 15-year-old load shedding crisis requires a ‘whole of society’ approach that is anchored on making electricity generation the biggest priority for the country in the next 5 years," said the DA in a statement. Eskom has warned of a possibility of stage 6 load shedding during the evening peak, blaming the intensified level of power cuts on the loss of generation capacity overnight  as well as the unlawful industrial action by its workers. The DA said Mantashe, as the minister responsible for securing South Africa's electricity needs and planning its energy future, has been obstructive and combative in his approach to dealing with proposed solutions. The party's shadow minister of mineral resources and energy  Kevin Mileham said Mantashe deserved to be singled out. "Minister Mantashe has proven to be a complete failure when it comes to managing South Africa’s energy crisis. In addition, he is tainted by the findings of the Zondo commission with regards to his Bosasa benefits and his role in cadre deployment and state capture. It is past time that the president fires him and replaces him with someone who is more in touch with the needs of the country.”
