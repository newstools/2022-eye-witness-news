JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure says there were no major incidents or disruptions reported countywide amid rumours of a national shutdown. Social media had been a buzz since the start of the week following the sharing of unverified posters calling for a national shut down. This week, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, South African National Taxi Council and National Taxi Alliance distanced themselves from the calls for a shutdown, saying their members would not be taking part. Authorities were on high alert as a result. Law enforcement agencies from KwaZulu-Natal and Cape Town are monitoring the situation.
