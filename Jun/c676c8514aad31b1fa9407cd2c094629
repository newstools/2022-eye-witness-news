JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa is tabling the Presidency’s budget at Parliament on Thursday afternoon. But the EFF has called on him to step aside amid criminal allegations against him. Last week, former director-general at the State Security Agency, Arthur Fraser, opened a criminal case against Ramaphosa, accusing him of concealing a crime from the police.
