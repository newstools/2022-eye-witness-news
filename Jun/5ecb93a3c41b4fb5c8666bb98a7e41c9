The South African Revenue Service (Sars) and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition will donate tonnes of seized clothing, blankets, and footwear to flood victims in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, North West, and the Free State. Project Sizani, We All Help was initiated after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster in response to the flooding.
