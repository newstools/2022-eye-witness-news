It's alleged that three former employees of the office were set to gain from the contract. The SIU's spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said that they could only investigate if and when a case was reported. A _Sunday Times _report said that the OCJ's former CFO Casper Coetzer, former spokesperson Nathi Mncube and former case management director, Yvonne van Niekerk, participated in setting up the contract before resigning last month. The Office of the Chief Justice released a statement saying that it was currently gathering all the relevant evidence needed and would update the public about the matter at an appropriate time.
