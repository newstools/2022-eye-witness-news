LONDON - Rain brought a halt to play after just 30 minutes on the first day of Wimbledon on Monday. Action on the outside courts was suspended at 11:40 local time (10:40 GMT), with officials saying there would be no resumption before 13:00. However, Novak Djokovic will be able to start his title defence on time later Monday, with his clash against Kwon Soon-woo of South Korea taking place beneath the Centre Court roof.
