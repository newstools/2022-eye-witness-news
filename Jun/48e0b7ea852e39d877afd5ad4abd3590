JOHANNESBURG - A group of Soweto residents in Moletsane have refused to back down from a protest on Bolani Street, causing minor disruptions in the area. Residents have vowed to continue their protest until their pleas are heard. They cited a lack of service delivery as the reason for their demonstration on Monday. Electricity billing also formed part of the residents' disgruntlement. The standoff between Eskom and residents has been a longstanding one. A community leader accused Eskom of abandoning its mandate - and only chasing after profits. "Eskom's mandate is profit. If Eskom wanted to assist Soweto per se they could have championed green electricity they could have given us at least a solar panel and say we are subsidising to this level and then you pay the remaining amount," said the man who identified himself as Dalton to Eyewitness News.
