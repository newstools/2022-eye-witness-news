JOHANNESBURG - As the African National Congress in Limpopo prepares to kick off its 10th provincial conference, one of its regions, Waterberg, is asking for a day to hold a conference in order to renew its mandate. In a short statement, the regional executive committee said it has written a letter on an urgent basis requesting to hold a one-day conference on Friday. The volatile region claims that despite existing disputes, it still meets the minimum 70% required threshold to elect new leaders. The conference will enable its delegates to participate in the weekend’s conference as a region. ANC Waterberg spokesperson Matome Moremi said: “The final audit report signed off by Paul Mashatile together with the NDRC report…. This means that the REC is ready to take itself to a regional conference.”
