There police are investigating the murder. KZN education head Muzi Mahlambi confirmed: "The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal can confirm that the educator that was shot at Riverdene school in Newlands West yesterday morning, succumbed in the evening at the hospital." The KZN Education Department said it was concerned about safety in all schools after the teacher was slain. This is not the first incident where a teacher has been murdered near or on the school premises. Muzi Mahlambi said they were worried about the rate in which schools were becoming soft targets. He added that he was hoping that the crime prevention summit held in the province last week - would also provide a solution to the safety concerns at schools. KZN education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has since conveyed his condolences to the family of the teacher.
