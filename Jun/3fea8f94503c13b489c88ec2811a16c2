(Scroll up to listen to the interview) It seems that just after 12 last night the wind picked up considerably which spotted the different areas on Lourensford itself. That drove the fire to Erinvale [Estate] and the Helderberg Nature Reserve.  The fire's quite close to the houses on the top section of Erinvale... They're protecting those properties. The only people that did evacuate to my knowledge, were the residents staying on the top section, that's four or five houses.  He says the biggest concern is one house with a thatched roof. ⚠️Fire Update⚠️📍#LourensfordFire pic.twitter.com/r8H7uEBxdW  Earlier on Saturday, NCC Wildfires provided images of the areas where they are fighting to contain the flareups.
