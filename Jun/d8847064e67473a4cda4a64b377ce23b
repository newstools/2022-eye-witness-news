JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) accompanied the Gardee family to the court appearance of the three individuals accused of murdering Hilary Gardee on Thursday morning. The murder accused trio - Sipho Mkhatshwa, Philemon Lukhele and Albert Gama - appeared before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court. The EFF arrived in droves, with posters and in song at the court appearance of Gardee's alleged killers. Gardee's lifeless body was found by timber plantation workers near a road in Sabie, outside Mbombela a few days after she went missing.
