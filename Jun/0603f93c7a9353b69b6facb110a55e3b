Parliament, which featured prominently in the commission, will have to report to the Public Protector regularly on its implementation of the reports as well as consider a constitutional amendment. Public Protector Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe: "For the purposes of monitoring the execution of all the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission and in compliance with paragraph 9.2 of Report No. 06 of 2016/17, periodic implementation reports from both Parliament and the Presidency have been requested for submission to the Public Protector South Africa." Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has also recommended that parliament amend the constitution to allow the direct election of the President. DA deputy chief whip Siviwe Gwarube however says more electoral reforms need to be processed by parliament. "We would like to see it implemented alongside other parliamentary reforms, because it’s not one silver bullet that’s going to change the vacuum or that’s going to strengthen the oversight mechanism of Parliament," Gwarube said.
