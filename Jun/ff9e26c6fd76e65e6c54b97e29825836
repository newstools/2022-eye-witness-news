JOHANNESBURG - The final instalment of the state capture report will be submitted to President Cyril Ramaphosa electronically on Sunday. The secretary of the commission, Itumeleng Mosala, said due to certain challenges, they were unable to submit the final part of the report to the President on Wednesday, the 15th of June, as scheduled. He added that the President will receive an electronic version on Sunday evening and that an official handover ceremony will take place at the Union Buildings on Monday. This is the fifth and final instalment of the state capture reports. The highly-anticipated report is expected to deal with outstanding issues, including matters at the SABC and the State Security Agency. The commission is also expected to make overall recommendations.
