CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde said more people will suffer and die from extending the lockdown than COVID-19. This comes after Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma extended the state of disaster on Friday. It was meant to expire on Saturday, but has been pushed back by a month till 15 February. Earlier this week, the DA made fresh calls for the state of disaster declaration to be withdrawn. Winde said the minister's move was a knee-jerk reaction. "We need to end this thing, and we need to end it now, we don't need the disaster we've got to focus on the other disaster which is that of poverty. We're losing more lives to crime, we lose more lives to road crashes  than to COVID-19 now". We must normalise our C-19 response & focus on the 2nd pandemic of unemployment. A State of Disaster isnt needed now & it needs to come to an end, with existing health legislation used going forward. Full statement here: https://t.co/V8qjR0gNKx pic.twitter.com/8jO3Enjitz
