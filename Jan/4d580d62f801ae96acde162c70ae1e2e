CAPE TOWN - The Cape Town City Hall has been chosen as the venue for the 2022 State of the Nation Address. The annual gathering had to be moved after large parts of the parliamentary building were gutted in a fire this week. Parliament's presiding officers deemed City Hall a suitable venue technically in terms of infrastructure and capacity. It was also chosen for its historical significance, being the place where former President Nelson Mandela made his first speech following his release from prison on 11 February 1990. The State of the Nation Address is scheduled for 10 February. Parliament said the rules of a joint sitting held outside the National Assembly would be followed ahead of the State of the Nation Address. Parts of the Parliamentary building were destroyed in a fire this week with the premises now a subject of an investigation. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said in order for the institution to continue its work, it would have to host the joint sitting off site. "The joint rules also prescribe, among others, the venue for a joint sitting. In this regard, a joint rule by the speaker and the chair person will allow Sona to be held in a venue other than the chamber of the National Assembly; we will not allow a situation where Parliament's work is derailed or disrupted in any manner."
