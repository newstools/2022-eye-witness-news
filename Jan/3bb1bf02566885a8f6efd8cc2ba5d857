CAPE TOWN - The man accused of torching Parliament’s National Assembly Chamber is to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Zandile Mafe appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Tuesday, where a charge of terrorism was added. Mafe threatened to go on a hunger strike if not released on bail. He will be remanded at Pollsmoor Prison pending the availability of a bed at Valkenburg Psychiatric Hospital. He will then undergo a 30-day evaluation to ascertain if he’s fit to stand trial. #ParliamentFire Scene outside Cape Town Magistrates Court following the court proceedings.

"He was referred on the 3rd, which was a Monday. At that stage he was not legally represented." The case has been postponed until 11 February, but Mafe’s legal team will apply for bail before then.
