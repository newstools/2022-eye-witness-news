Current vaccines target only the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus. Dr Soon-Shiong said the aim is to produce at least one billion doses by 2025. “We’re comfortable that we can do that and the answer to that is, therefore, therein being the largest south-amplifying RNA facility in the world,” he said. Around 400 to 600 people will be employed at the production hub. The project will also go hand-in-hand with a R100 million education and training programme in biotechnology and life sciences. #NantSA a division of Nantworks LLC  together with the CSIR, Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI), Universities of Cape Town, - Witwatersrand, - Stellenbosch, - KwaZulu-Natal and Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa partnered on the project.
