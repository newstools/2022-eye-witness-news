JOHANNESBURG - The Springbok Sevens have continued their world domination in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series when they defeated Australia 33-7 in the Seville Sevens round. The Blitzboks were forced to come from behind in the final thanks to tries from Christoffel Grobbelaar either side of the half.

The series victory favourably colours the South Africans who struggled on Saturday in their pool matches against the USA (winning 24-19) and Scotland (31-24). The Blitzboks are on a record-equalling 34-match win streak and have won the opening four tournaments of the 2022 season – six consecutive tournament wins since the end of last season. Next up, the tour travels to Singapore between 9 and10 April where the reigning world champs were drawn in Pool A alongside the USA, Kenya and Canada. The South Africans are 18 points clear at the top of the World Series standings - South Africa are on 88 points, Argentina second (70) and Australia rounding out the top three (66).
