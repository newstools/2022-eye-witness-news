The man arrested on arson charges related to the fire at Parliament will remain behind bars until his court appearance next week. Zandile Christmas Mafe (49) appeared before the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Mafe also faces charges of theft, housebreaking and contravention of the National Key Points Acts. The case been postponed for the State and investigators to confirm details regarding bail. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said that investigators also had not been able to visit the crime scene yet. "We've not been able to assess the damage because the crime scene was still active until late yesterday. When we come here by next Tuesday, I'm sure we'll have that information and I'm sure you've heard that the defence is intending to apply for bail. The State will oppose it," Ntabazalila said. Mafe’s defence attorney, Luvuyo Godla, said that his client was being made a scapegoat for failures of the executive and legislature. "My client denies and rejects these charges and therefore he is pleading not guilty and he will continue pleading not guilty," Godla said. The case has been postponed until 11 January.
