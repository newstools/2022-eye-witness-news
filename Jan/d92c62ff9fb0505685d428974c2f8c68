Manager at Camps Bay’s Primi Seacastle guesthouse, Andrew Godongwana, said that they were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. "We didn't have lots of guests and local supporters were unable to help us keep it running and we had to close some of our other properties," Godongwana said. Provincial Chief Inspector, David Esau, said that businesses were also being assessed based on the compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) as well as the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act. "We have made a plea to all the labour federations to provide us with companies that we should visit but we also have our own national database that we are working from," Esau said. Esau said that some of the 325 inspectors would be deployed to businesses in the Cape Town CBD and Bloubergstrand, while others will focus on the Overberg and Strand regions.
