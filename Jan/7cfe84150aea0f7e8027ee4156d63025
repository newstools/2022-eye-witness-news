Volume one deals with the South African Airways and its associated companies. Volume two deals with the New Age and volume three deals with Sars as well as the topic of public procurement in South Africa.” He said the second part of the report would come at the end of January followed by the last part of the report at the end of February. “We are very pleased that we were able to deliver part one of the report.
