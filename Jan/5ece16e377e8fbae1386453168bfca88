While South Africans remain with various unanswered questions following the fire, the prince said the incident needed to be thoroughly investigated. Buthelezi is one of the senior members who has been serving since 1994. In a statement on Monday, Buthelezi recalled when South Africa's first democratic elected President Nelson Mandela took to the podium for the first time in the house. He said he spent 28 years of his life there  and it was unbelievable that it no longer existed. Buthelezi said although the situation remained, there needed to be an assurance that such would never happen again.
