This was a culmination of their hard work under difficult conditions during the pandemic. The National Alliance of Independent Schools Associations’ Ebrahim Ansur said for the IEB schools to still improve on the overall pass rate compared to the class of 2020 was remarkable. “We’ve got to really compliment these children on their resilience. It’s not easy to cope with school life,” he said. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will release the national pass rate for government schools on Thursday, while students will receive their individual marks the following day.
