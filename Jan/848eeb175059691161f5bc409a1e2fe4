We paid cows for the queen’s [the late Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu] bride price. We knew she would give birth to an heir.” Nyandeni also issued a warning to those who are against him. “We would like to warn those that are against the king that they’re insulting the throne and Zulu customs and traditions.” The regiments said they know that tradition and customs only point to him as the next king.
