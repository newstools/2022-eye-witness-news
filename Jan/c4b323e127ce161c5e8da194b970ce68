CAPE TOWN - The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said that despite the country entering its peak malaria season, many malaria cases were being misdiagnosed as COVID-19. The NCID said that both malaria and COVID-19 have similar non-specific early symptoms including fever, chills, headaches, fatigue and muscle pain. The NICD's Dr Jaishree Raman said that undiagnosed and untreated malaria rapidly progresses to severe illness, with a potentially fatal outcome. "Any individual presenting with fever or flu-like illness or who resides in a malaria area like Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal or Mpumalanga or if they've travelled to a malaria-risk area, especially Mozambique in the last six weeks, they must be tested for malaria," Raman said. #MalariaAlert Any individual who has travelled to a malaria-risk area in the past six weeks and is presenting with fever or flu-like illness, must inform their healthcare provider and get tested for malaria.
