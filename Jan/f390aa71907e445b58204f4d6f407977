JOHANNESBURG - Parts of western and southern Joburg have been rattled by an early morning earthquake. It's believed that the epicentre of the 3.3 magnitude tremor was located between Carletonville and Westonaria. The quake was felt by residents as far away as the Vaal at about 6:30am. The Council for Geoscience's chief scientist Eldridge Kgaswane: "If we get earthquakes beyond a local magnitude scale of 4 that should be a cause for concern because according to our standards you're actually starting to go into huge magnitude scales." Kgaswane said that the latest earthquake was likely related to nearby mining activity. "It is rational to say that it could be mining related. It's not clear as to what type of mining activity could have caused this if it is mining-related," Kgaswane said. Earth tremors in Gauteng are usually caused by mining activities as opposed to a shift in tectonic plates.
