The minister has urged the public to refrain from spreading false information: “But I think what I found in the media was very shocking, very demoralising. I was shocked when they said one of our children has killed her. So, I am looking forward to the police getting the correct culprit.” A police task team has been assigned to investigate the killing of the deputy principal. Meanwhile, Motshekga said funeral preparations were under way
