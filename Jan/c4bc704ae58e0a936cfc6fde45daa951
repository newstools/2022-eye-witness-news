JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) deputy president David Mabuza said that the ANC government would have to move faster in addressing service delivery shortcomings or risk being voted out of power. Mabuza was speaking at a meeting with local traditional leaders in Polokwane on Wednesday. The ANC's top six leaders are in Limpopo for the party's 110th birthday celebration this weekend, where the governing party will chart a way forward for the year ahead. Mabuza admitted that the party was grappling with problems and assured members that these were being attended to. "We've come to realise that, taking it from past elections, we've heard our people crying about service delivery and this time around we are going to respond and we must to move a bit faster otherwise if we're not making that commitment, it means that we have said that we must be voted out of government," Mabuza said. Mabuza's remarks come just two months after the party was battered at the local government elections and after the release of part one of the Zondo Commission report, which has painted a damning picture of how the ruling party abused the government tender system to enrich itself and its allies.
