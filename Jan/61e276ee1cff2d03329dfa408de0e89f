CAPE TOWN - There are concerns that a high inflation forecast will leave the South African Reserve Bank with little choice but to hike interest rates. Governor Lesetja Kjganyago on Thursday announced a 25 basis points hike in the repo rate to 4%. Nedbank Economist Isaac Matshego said that the inflation outlook is worrying. "Should inflation be stickier than currently expected, the Reserve Bank could be a lot more hawkish and hike for longer than we expect," Matshego said. #MPCJAN22 pic.twitter.com/LT44L9W4in
