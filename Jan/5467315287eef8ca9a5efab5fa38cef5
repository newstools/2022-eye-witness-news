"Honestly, I don't know how I feel at the moment, it's a whole bunch of emotions. I was excited to come back to school to start a new grade but now with the flood, I don't know, we're like way behind. They're telling us we'll start on Monday but I don't think we'll start on Monday," Shobole said. Some of the teachers are on the school premises helping cleaners with mop-up operations. The teachers are hoping that they’ll be able to start schooling on Monday.
