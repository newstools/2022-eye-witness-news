JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Nkangala is remembering Emalahleni Mayor Linah Malatjie as a committed activist who played a key role in stabilising governance and systems in her local municipality. The mayor and her husband, Esau Malatjie, died in an accident while travelling between Kwamhlanga and Emalahleni on Sunday night. Their car collided with a bakkie - the driver of the bakkie died on the scene while the couple passed away in hospital. Linah Malatjie served as Nkangala mayor from 2011 before being redeployed to Emalahleni in 2014. She was officially sworn in as Emalahleni mayor after the 2016 local government elections.

"Her key focus as the executive mayor was on the accelerated service delivery programme which was underway across the city. We are forever grateful for her selfless contribution to the freedom of the people of South Africa," Matshoga said. He said that she belonged to a generation of post-apartheid activists. "The ANC will remember her as a committed activist who served in our structure in various capacities. She belonged to the generation of the post-apartheid activists who gave empathy to our struggles beyond the unbanning. Comrade Linah Malatjie was the forefront of the struggle towards the advancement of women, emancipation and empowerment," he said. A delegation from the Mpumalanga government has gone to visit the Malatjie family and is expected to give further details afterwards.
