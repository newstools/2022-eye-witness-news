JOHANNESBURG - JOHANNESBURG - ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba has tendered his resignation as a councillor in the City of Johannesburg. In a statement via his political party on Monday, Mashaba said he sent a letter to Speaker Vasco da Gama on Sunday and that his resignation would be effective as of 28 February. Mashaba said after the local government elections, which were held in November last year, he decided to oversee the first few months of his party in the council and that now was the time to step back and afford that opportunity to another party member. Eyewitness News reported last week that he was leaving to focus on growing his organisation and the 2024 general elections. Mashaba said his time would now be spent building the party across all nine provinces. This is the second time that Mashaba calls it quits on the City of Joburg, in 2019, he walked away from the mayoral chain. Eyewitness News previously reported that he had been mulling over the resignation, first consulting his caucus and then the senate of his party. Mashaba in a short statement confirms this, saying he was happy with the calibre of leaders serving ActionSA in the Joburg city council. ActionSA has assisted the Democratic Alliance gain control of all three of Gauteng’s metros – and has some of its members serving in the mayoral committees and as committee chairpersons. The businessman turned politician – who just recently announced former Midvaal mayor Bongani Baloyi as a new member and part of the team building ActionSA – will now focus on the upcoming elections and ensuring its represented in every province.
