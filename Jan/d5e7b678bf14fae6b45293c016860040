JOHANNESBURG - Following the attack on the Constitutional Court building, the Office of the Chief Justice has warned that the security of the judiciary remained compromised and required urgent attention. On Wednesday, one person was arrested for smashing the windows and glass doors at the ConCourt with a hammer. This follows the fire at Parliament on Sunday that's being blamed on arson. Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has noted with grave concern the attack on the Constitutional Court building on Wednesday. In a statement, he said that this crime, along with some recent unprecedented attacks on some superior courts, seeks to destroy these important facilities.
