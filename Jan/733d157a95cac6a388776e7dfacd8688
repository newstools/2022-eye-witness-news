The report said that Myeni, a former board chair, proceeded through a mixture of negligence, incompetence, and deliberate corrupt intent, to dismantle governance procedures at the airline. In a statement released on Monday morning, the current interim board said that it would also institute internal investigations and disciplinary processes where necessary to rid the company of a shameful past. Former SAA former group treasurer, Cynthia Stimpel, who testified at the inquiry and worked during Myeni's tenure, said that she was pleased with the conclusions reached by the commission. "I feel vindicated and very happy at the comprehensiveness that the report is written. Even if one looks at the lack of parts, it brings a whole section of how the abuse of the procurement process damaged SAA, so I think a well-rounded report," Stimpel said.
