Cape Town fire authorities said that the fourth and fifth floors of the new wing, above the National Assembly, had been completely gutted. The roof of the building is now also completely destroyed. Chief fire officer, Ian Schnetler, said that two fire engines were still on the scene. "A command vehicle and a moving apparatus vehicle are present. It's very quiet. The regional commander is doing a preliminary inspection on the fourth and the fifth floor," Schnetler said. Parliament said that the flare-up has caused further damage to more floors of the building, which housed offices of members of Parliament, as well as support staff. Parliament added that firefighters would remain on site for further inspections of the various parts of the building. Officials expect that a multidisciplinary team of engineers, which arrived on Monday, will conduct assessments and establish the scale of the damage once they're given the all-clear to go in.
