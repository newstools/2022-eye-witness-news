CAPE TOWN - Gauteng has exited the COVID-19 fourth wave. Health Minister Joe Phaahla and a panel of experts gave an update on the pandemic on Friday. Phaahla said that there'd been a 27% drop in the number of new COVID-19 cases being recorded nationally, compared with the previous week. "Gauteng province has officially exited the fourth wave in terms of the technical definition of a wave. All other provinces have reached their peaks and are now on a decline," Minister Phaahla said. The minister, however, stressed that COVID-19 still posed a risk. "... especially for people with advanced age and also people with co-morbidities as you will see later on for the unvaccinated," the minister explained.
