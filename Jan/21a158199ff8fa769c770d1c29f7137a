JOHANNESBURG - Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille on Tuesday said the Hawks still had the drone footage of the destruction caused by the fire in Parliament and would not be releasing it for now as the investigation continued. A report has been handed over to the Joint Standing Committee on the Financial Management of Parliament. It describes how checks were carried on the various systems, with some problems sorted out by Parliament's IT department just over a week before the fire.

National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and a delegation of Nehawu have held an urgent meeting on Tuesday. After the fire broke out on Sunday, the union said none of its members in the parliamentary protections’ services were on duty. It said shop stewards were told that for December, they should not work weekends and public holidays because of the budgetary constraints. Nehawu has agreed to hand over any crucial information for the investigation.
