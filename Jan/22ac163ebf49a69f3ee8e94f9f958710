Meanwhile, Health Minister Joe Phaahla has encouraged new mothers to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months to ensure that their babies get the necessary nutrition and immunisation from birth. A child`s health is most vulnerable during the first 1,000 days of their lives and the right nutrition during this period can have a profound impact on a child's ability to develop and learn. "Babies need only milk feeds for the first six months of life, but milk continues to be an important source of nutrients to children after six months, therefore there is no need to put a time limit on feeds", the minister said. Phaahla congratulated all the new parents and wished them and their babies good health.
