JOHANNESBURG - The judicial commission of inquiry into state capture has recommended that former Transnet boss Brian Molefe, former South African Airways (SAA) CEO Collin Matjila and Tony Gupta face criminal prosecution for fraud and contravening the Public Finance Management Act over irregular contracts with The New Age publication. These are just some of the prominent figures among several others named in the 870-plus pages forming three volumes of part one of Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s report.

Zondo handed over part one of his report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday and it has since been published on the Presidency’s website. According to the report from the Zondo Commission, state capture thrived at the country’s state-owned entities in spite of the existence of laws designed to prevent these dodgy dealings from taking place.

It also recommended that both Molelfe and Matjila be investigated by law enforcement agencies. Molefe and Matjila presented sponsorship deals as partnerships, pretending that the Guptas were also contributing. The Zondo Commissions said that to avoid a similar crisis in the future, law enforcement needed to hold those who ignored their legal obligations to account.
