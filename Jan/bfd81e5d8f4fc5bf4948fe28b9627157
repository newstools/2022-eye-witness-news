JOHANNESBURG - ActionSA has postponed Monday's media briefing where it had planned to give an update on the coalition in Ekurhuleni. In a short media alert announcing the cancellation, the party said that it was doing so to allow for further engagements with the coalition government. Tensions between the Democratic Alliance (DA) and ActionSA stemmed from the negotiation table and have continued as they attempt to co-govern. Some coalition partners have accused the DA of being arrogant. ActionSA said that it would approach these fresh talks in good faith.
