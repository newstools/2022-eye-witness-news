There’s so many people I can give credit to.” "There’s so many people who played a role for this, not only on the field. My family has been my number one supporter; my parents, my wife. They’ve been amazing. I also have to give credit to our coaching staff, and teammates. If it wasn’t for them I honestly wouldn’t even be able to play," Lee said. When accepting the award, the opening batter singled out the first ODI of the Proteas Womens tour where she hit 91 not out. "It was pretty tough conditions. That was probably one of the best, I thought it was a hard-fought game," Lee said. The opener was named player of the match as the South Africans won by eight wickets. South Africa will hope that Lee can continue this form when the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup is scheduled to be held in New Zealand. The Proteas women begin their tournament against Bangladesh on 5 March.
