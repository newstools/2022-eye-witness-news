DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal police have arrested a 40-year-old man linked to the kidnapping and killing of another man that he accused of being in a relationship with his ex-fiancé. Asanda Dlamini went missing in October last year. His body was found by police over the weekend after the suspect led them to a location where he allegedly buried Dlamini's remains. The suspect is due to appear in the KwaDukuza Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele said: “The skeletal remains were found in the bushes. The suspect was arrested and charged for kidnapping and murder. It’s alleged he kidnapped and killed Dlamini for dating his ex- fiancé.”
