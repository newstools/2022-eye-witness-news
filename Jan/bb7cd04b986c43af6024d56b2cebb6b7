CPUT acting Chief Engineer Nyameko Royi explains: "The first thing for us it to prove that the concept works. We'll be getting that information to CPUT, at our ground station, and once everything works in order and we see that the supplies are working, then the government department will take care of that." The Department of Science and Innovation's Mmboneni Muofhe: "Our oceans are a huge contributor to our economy and we, therefore, have to constantly have a sense of who is in our waters, what are they doing, are they there illegally or legally or also in terms of monitoring the algae blooms which can actually be dangerous for our fishing industry."
