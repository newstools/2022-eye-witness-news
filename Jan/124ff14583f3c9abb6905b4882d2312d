The party has joined in those welcoming commission chairperson Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo handing over the first part of the report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday. It was also made public.

The ANC said that it was hopeful that the commission’s report would detail the nature and extent of state capture and corruption in the country. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe said that the ANC’s national executive committee would also study the report. "We will support government as it considers the report findings and recommendations and under takes the work necessary to restore good governance and decisively tackle all forms of corruption within the state and across society," Mabe said.
