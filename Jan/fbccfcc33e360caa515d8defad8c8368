JOHANNESBURG - The Spar Proteas led by Bongi Msomi will be competing in the 2022 Netball Quad Series in London from 15 to 19 January. The national team will be competing against hosts England, New Zealand, and Australia at the Copper Box Arena, in London. The  last time South Africa played at the Quad Series was back in 2019 in London ahead of the Netball World Cup. The inaugural Netball Quad Series was played in 2016 and since then, the Diamonds (Australia) have won five of the six titles, with their most recent victory coming at the last Quad Series in 2019. South Africa's Anso Kemp and Elizna van den Berg will also fly the flag high as they will be umpires at the tournament. Congratulations to umpires  Anso Kemp and Elizna van den Berg whove been selected for the Netball Quad Series taking place from 15-19 January at the Copper Box Arena in London.

Spar Proteas have been busy over the last few months, traveling to Ireland and Northern Island before traveling to Namibia where they successfully defended their Africa Netball Cup title. Ahead of the team selection, the Spar Proteas and their head coach Dorette Badenhorst spent a week in Stellenbosch at a training camp. “I am very happy with the work that the players put in during the training camp. It was also unfortunate that we could not have our UK-based players due to travel restrictions, however, the intensity and hard work rate that came out from the ones we had here was impressive,” said Badenhorst following the team's announcement. South Africa has been removed from the red list by the United Kingdom.

As a team, we want to perform very well at this tournament and I am looking forward to seeing how our new players will fare against top nations in the world and seeing how our combinations will work.
