He said there are plans for change also to keep the city clean: “We had a workshop were Pikitup is going to look at having bins at every corner [of the city].” And he said there is a plan for general crime: “Remember, we had over 1500 officials that were said to be unqualified. They were qualified but that was just a political gimmick. We will try put those 1,500 officials in the inner city and ensure that wherever we have our CCTV cameras, they are being monitored.”
