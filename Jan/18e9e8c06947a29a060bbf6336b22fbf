CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape should soon be getting more trains soon. That's if Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula is to be believed. He toured some of Cape Town's railway lines on Monday morning to see for himself upgrades to infrastructure. #CTtrians The minister, MEC Daylin Mitchell and mayco member for Transport Rob Quintus at Tygerberg station.

But for how long will they stay this way given how trains are prime targets for criminals? Security will also have to be improved to spare them from vandals and thieves. Minister Mbalula said more new train sets were expected to be rolled onto the city's railway lines in the coming months. Prasa regional manager Richard Walker said there were currently 12 new trains in operation, but only for commercial off-peak services. He hopes 16 new train sets will be in service by mid-year. Mbalula said that the new trains would reduce overcrowding and were safer.
