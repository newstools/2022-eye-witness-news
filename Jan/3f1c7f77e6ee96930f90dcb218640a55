They took the ambulance keys, they robbed us basically. They mugged us.” Lesesa said community members heard her screams, but no one came to their rescue. She said she was still shaken by the attack. “It was traumatising. It’s not nice to be at someone else’s mercy like that.” EMS personnel have called on the Reiger Park community to report criminals who attack ambulance crews and work together with authorities to ensure those who work to save their lives also feel safe.
