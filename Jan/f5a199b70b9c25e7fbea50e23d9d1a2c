CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the City of Ekurhuleni has welcomed the metro's clean audit. The Auditor-General has found no irregular, unauthorised, fruitless or wasteful expenditure. It's the second consecutive clean audit for the metro under an ANC-led coalition. "We were able to submit our financial statement without any material errors. You will know that, for instance, there is a lot of corruption as well as maladministration around the state procurement and supply chain management. So as the  City of Ekurhuleni we were not found wanting by the Auditor-General to contravene the supply chain  management policy, so we are clean in that regard," said   ANC Council Chief Whip Jongizizwe Dlabathi.
