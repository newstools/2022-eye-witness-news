JOHANNESBURG - The case against Onthatile Sebati and her two co-accused has been postponed in the Brits Magistrate's Court after the state revealed Sebati needed to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Sebati, Tumelo and Kagiso Mokone all face five counts of murder relating to the 2016 killing of her parents and two siblings in Mmakau near Brits. The trio appeared in court for a formal bail application, which has been postponed to 18 January. "Accused number two, which is the lady in the matter, needed to be sent for psychological assessment. The results will determine whether she needs to be sent for psychiatric evaluation or not, so the matter is postponed to 18 January  which is next week Tuesday," said the NPA's Lumka Mahanjana. #MmakauMurders Onthatile Sebatis aunt Japhtaline Sebati says she doesnt know why her niece confessed to killing her brother, Lucky Sebati and his family.
