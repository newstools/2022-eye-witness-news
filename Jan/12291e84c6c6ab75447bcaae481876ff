JOHANNESBURG - The Ekurhuleni Metro on Monday said residents in Kempton Park would have to go another night without electricity. There's been a power outage in the area since Friday due to faulty cables. Affected areas include Norkem Park, Glen Marais, Allen Grove, Kempton Park Extension 4 and parts of Pomona. Authorities said the fault on the 66-kilo vault network had been located and repair work began at the weekend. The city's spokesperson Zweli Dlamini said teams were still on site: “We do hope that we'll be able to restore power fully by tomorrow.”
