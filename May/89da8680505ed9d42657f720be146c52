CAPE TOWN - There's been another major road tragedy in the country, this time in Mpumalanga. Nine people died in a bus crash on Sunday morning. The bus driver appeared to have lost control of the vehicle on the N3 between Heidelberg and Villiers. It then overturned into a stream before hitting a bridge. In KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday, 16 people were killed on the N3. The victims were in a taxi which was involved in a crash with several other vehicles. Officials believe the 10-vehicle pile-up was caused by a truck driver who lost control and overturned on the N3 highway.
