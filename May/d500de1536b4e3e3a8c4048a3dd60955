JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is expected to visit the Ratanda Primary and Khanya Secondary schools in Heidelberg on Friday morning. The MEC’s visit follows the news that three pupils died on Thursday after consuming energy drinks. The siblings aged from six, 13, 16 complained of stomach pains while at school.
