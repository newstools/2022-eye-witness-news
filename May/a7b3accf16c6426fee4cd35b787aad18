JOHANNESBURG - Mpumalanga police have confirmed they’re investigating a case of murder following the discovery of Hillary Gardee’s body on Tuesday morning. The daughter of former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) secretary-general and attorney Godrich Gardee, 28-year-old Hillary, was reported missing over the weekend after she was last seen in the Nelspruit CBD on Friday afternoon.
