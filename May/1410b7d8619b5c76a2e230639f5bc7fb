JOHANNESBURG - People Opposing Women Abuse (Powa) said that there's a war against women in South Africa. Powa was reacting to Singwa Namhla Mtwa's death. Mtwa was shot dead in her car at her home in Mthatha last month. It’s alleged that her boyfriend of 17 years was behind her killing. "I mean you still feel that the government is not doing enough. Us, as Powa, and other organisations, I think we are trying our best but alone we are not going to win in this fight - it's a fight, it's war against women. We need commitment from the government. We always talk about our policies that are in place but I think our problem is implementation," said Powa's Jeanette Sera.
