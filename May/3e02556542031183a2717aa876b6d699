CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG - The 20-year-old complainant in the Stellenbosch racist incident has opened a criminal complaint with the police against a fellow student who broke into his room and urinated on his personal belongings. First year Agricultural Business Management student Babalo Ndwayana also wants first year Law student, Theuns du Toit, expelled. Ndwayana had recorded Du Toit urinating on his desk, laptop and study material in Huis Marais dorm room on Sunday. #StellenboschUniversity Ndwayana says he wants Du Toit to be expelled from the university.

As it stands, if a university expels a student for whatever transgression, it can share this information with any other institution in the country. But Universities South Africa's Dr Linda Meyer said this was not enough. She said this should not be limited to public institutions: “But also, where students leave public institutions and go and study at private higher institutions because they don’t have the same checks and balances...” Additional reporting by Kgomotso Modise.
