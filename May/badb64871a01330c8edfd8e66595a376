JOHANNESBURG – Friday marks the deadline for the South African Revenue Services (Sars) and Treasury to respond to workers union Nehawu’s 12% wage increase demand. The union had given the two companies 72 hours to respond to their demands on Wednesday when they embarked on their full-blown strike. Sars has so far offered a 1.3% salary hike indicating it is the best it can offer. Nehwau is adamant that the revenue service can afford to meet their demands. The union’s Lwazi Nkolonzi said: "Our members are striking for the demands they've placed before Sars which amongst others include a salary adjustment of 12%, equal medical aid and housing allowance and a token of appreciation of R2,000 amongst these many demands we've placed before Sars."
