CAPE TOWN - An Eastern Cape alleged fraudster is due back in court in July. Lesedi Mothuse allegedly forged her matric certificate and is now facing a fraud charge to the tune of R1.7 million. Mothuse appeared in the Mthatha Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday. The prosecution said Mothuse submitted the document to secure a job as a senior data capturer with the Eastern Cape health department back in 2011. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said: “She submitted a fraudulent certificate claiming to have passed matric. She only resigned after the department received a tip off. She was arrested and released on R4,000 bail.”
