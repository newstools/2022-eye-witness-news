"I want to encourage everyone that I will not die prematurely, and we trust God to deliver us, we trust him to encourage us. I've been warned very strongly not to entertain that thinking and to rather speak life because death and life is in the power of the tongue," Phalatse said. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has described Moerane as a leader who believed in equality. "I want to say this city, this province and this country does not belong to political parties, it belongs to the people of our country, to the law-abiding citizens and residents of our land". Moerane (52) leaves behind his three children, wife and mother.
