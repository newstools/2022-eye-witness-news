JOHANNESBURG - Following an impasse for most of the day on whether or not four suspended office bearers should be allowed to stand at Saftu’s elective conference, a caucus from the federation’s unions has decided they will be allowed to contest the elections. An announcement to this effect was made on Wednesday with the Independent Electoral Commission now preparing ballots for delegates to vote.

The four were suspended after issuing Saftu’s general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi with an intention for suspension notice. This conference also voted against a motion brought forward by Numsa for the four to be reinstated on Tuesday. Democratised Transport Logistics and Allied Workers Union General Secretary Vusi Ntshangase said: “In the interest of democracy and in the interest of unity in this congress to allow the suspended national office bearers to contest the elections.”
