      RELATED: What happens to South Africa if the Eskom grid collapses?   Whats the difference between a power station and a storage station? "The big difference is one stores energy and the other generates energy", the Professor says.  "Coal is burned and that thermal energy is used to convert water into steam and then the steam is used to drive the turbine and the turbine generates electricity."  "When we are in desperate need of electricity, it can quickly dispatch that energy by driving the water through a turbine using gravity to generate more electricity. It's like a backup flush",    "Of those 48 gigawatts, we have fully operational and guaranteed to be working just above 24 gigawatts. So, we're in a pretty dire state with Eskom." In summer, the demand ranges from 24 gigawatts to 32 gigawatts. In winter, demand ranges from 25 to 37 depending of the time of day.    In other words, 1 kg of CO2 per kWh. "This makes South Africa at least the biggest emitter in Africa but also a very dirty electricity generator", Prof Booysen explains.   This article first appeared on CapeTalk : What in the megawatt?
