It said that since the programme was introduced, more evidence has emerged around the efficacy of Ivermectin. This includes the World Health Organization issuing an advisory that only recommended Ivermectin use within the context of clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration issued a similar caution, warning the anti-parasitic drug has not been shown to be safe or effective and taking large doses is dangerous. In South Africa, no further importation of unregistered Ivermectin products will be allowed and health facilities will no longer be enabled to hold bulk stock in anticipation of prescriptions.
