JOHANNESBURG - Another higher learning institution is dealing with allegations of rape. This time, a student from the University of Cape Town (UCT) has taken to social media, claiming she was raped by a member of staff. The woman said she had been subjected to harassment and sexual misconduct since 2019. In a series of tweets posted anonymously, the woman claims she reported the incident to UCT officials, but her pleas for the suspension of her alleged attacker were ignored. Im a UCT student raped by a UCT professor on UCT premesis. I reported thus to UCT & for months they failed to act/suspend rapist. UCT has instructed me to not report the matter & keep it internal. I received threats from rapist. Im in witness protection.  She said no action has been taken against the staff member. She also opened a case with the police. Police have confirmed that a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm is being investigated and no arrests have been made. This student has refused help from the university. She must say what her real agenda is. pic.twitter.com/qW61XzgViL  UCT notes with serious concern an alleged sexual assault incident raised through a series of anonymous tweets. pic.twitter.com/bqYCXdGVTU  The man at the centre of the allegations works for both the university and the Western Cape health department.
