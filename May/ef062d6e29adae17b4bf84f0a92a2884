JOHANNESBURG - Numsa is meeting on Thursday to discuss a way forward after the Johannesburg Labour Court interdicted its members at ArcelorMittal South Africa from continuing with their wage strike. Workers downed tools and took to the streets on Tuesday after wage negotiations deadlocked. They're demanding a 10% increase and refusing to accept a 5% offer from the company. However, ArcelorMittal South Africa secured an interim interdict on Wednesday preventing workers at the blast furnaces, coke batteries and the steel plant from striking until a final ruling has been made on the matter.
