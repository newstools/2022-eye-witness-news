JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has announced the extension of stage 2 load shedding for Saturday and Sunday from 8 am until 10 pm. The battling state owned utility said it needs to preserve its emergency reserves. It said it has done this to also maintain current diesel stocks. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshatsha said: “Eskom is expecting a ship containing diesel supplies to land on Monday and offload its cargo through Tuesday. If the current burn rate persists, diesel will be depleted ahead of the ship offloading.”
