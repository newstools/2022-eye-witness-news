He assumed the post for a month after Jolidee Matongo was also killed in a car accident. Matongo had replaced Geoff Makhubo, who died from COVID-19 complications.

The family held an impromptu briefing at the Milpark Hospital just minutes after Moerane’s passing. Family spokesperson Mike Maile paid tribute to the former mayor’s life of servitude. "He was a selfless person who would at any given time go out of his way to help. He dedicated his time to serving the community - those were his neighbours, those were his friends, those were his parents and he led many other community programs," Maile said. Moerane leaves behind his wife, four children, and several siblings. The family has asked for privacy to mourn his death.
