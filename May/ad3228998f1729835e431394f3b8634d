JOHANNESBURG - South Africa could be in for another night in the dark  after Eskom said that it could not guarantee that it would be able to provide electricity to all households and businesses at all times this week. The utility implemented stage two power cuts from 5pm to 10pm on Monday and Tuesday this week  as it experienced more problems with its generation system. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha said that the high demand in  winter  was also affecting Eskom's overall ability to provide its only service to the country. "The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will relate to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly in the evening and morning peaks, unfortunately, this will generally require the implementation of load shedding during the evening peaks," he said.
