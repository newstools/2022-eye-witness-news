CAPE TOWN - The Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Department said it’s formed partnerships to help protect  communities against climate change. The burning issue was discussed virtually on Tuesday among officials from government, the weather service, the South African Local Government Association. The department's Tlou Ramaru explained some work they're doing to try to protect vulnerable communities against the impact of climate change. "We are working together with Sanbi, we are working with  Sars on the multi-hazard integrated early warning systems as well. We are working with Sanbi on the resilience and interventions  in Limpopo, Northern Cape and KZN," Ramaru said. The recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal are a sobering reminder of just how exposed we can be to changes in the climate. South African  Local Government Association's Slindile Maphumulo stresses the importance of municipalities investing in infrastructure that can withstand risks. "Research could go towards the future impact of climate change and recommendations of best practice. Climate education is also a vitally important one so that planners, emergency managers, and educators are all involved in the climate change phase." The Climate Change Bill is before Parliament. It will give municipalities a legal basis from which to integrate climate change planning into their programmes.
