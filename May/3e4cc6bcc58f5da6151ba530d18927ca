CAPE TOWN - South Africans will have to contend with more power cuts this week, as Eskom on Sunday confirmed that Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 5pm-10pm throughout the week. In a statement, the power utility says due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, it's forced to implement loadshedding during the week. The state-owned entity also warned there is a possibility that power might need to be implemented outside of planned hours. #PowerAlert2 Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 throughout the week. pic.twitter.com/E40GBxaAjs  The ailing power utility also says it's expecting a supply of diesel from a ship which is expected to dock on Monday, which will help meet electricity demand.
