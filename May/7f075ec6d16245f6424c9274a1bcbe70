JOHANNESBURG - Ratings agency Standard & Poor Global has revised South Africa's credit rating outlook from stable to positive. It's also affirmed the long term foreign and local currency debt ratings at BB- and BB, respectively. Government has reacted by saying it welcomes S&P's decision. According to the ratings agency, recent favourable terms of trade in South Africa have improved the external and fiscal trajectory. S&P also notes some improvement in the implementation of key reform targets under Operation Vulindlela. The operation was established in October 2020 as a joint initiative of the presidency and national treasury to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms. There is also higher than expected tax revenue with a focus now on debt stabilisation.
