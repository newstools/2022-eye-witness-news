JOHANNESBURG - Former Johannesburg mayor Mpho Moerane is set to be laid to rest in his hometown Alexandra on Sunday. ANC Johannesburg regional members, City of Johannesburg council members, family and friends will convene for the final send off. Moerane passed away on Wednesday last week following a car accident. It is understood he was traveling from Alexandra to his home in Bryanston when the crash occurred. The ANC leader was appointed mayor just a month before last year's local government elections. His time at the helm was cut short when the ANC lost the city to the Democratic Alliance. A memorial service was held on Friday where he was hailed for his dedication to community service and activism. Moerane will be honoured with a civic funeral where President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the eulogy.
