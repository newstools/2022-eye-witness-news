CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday called for a state of disaster to be declared over Eskom and the ailing electricity sector. The party also announced that it had taken the “unprecedented” step to have this issue placed on the agenda of the next Cabinet meeting.

STAGE 2 ANNOUNCED Earlier, Eskom announced it would implement stage 2 power cuts between 5pm and 10pm on Thursday night. The power utility said this was due to continued constraints on the power grid. Eskom has implemented power cuts during the evening peak since Monday as it struggles to meet the demand for power. It again reiterated that the implementation of rolling blackouts were a last resort to protect the national power grid. #POWERALERT1 Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00  22:00 tonight due to continued constraints on the power system pic.twitter.com/HIbKEAc1FG
