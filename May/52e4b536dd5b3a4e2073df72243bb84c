I wanted to hear the accounts first-hand from the people living through this nightmare. I didn’t want to have to rely on a filtered, sanitised version of events, and I didn’t want to have any doubts over the accuracy or truthfulness of what we’re seeing on TV.” He said the war should be condemned by the South African government and that it would have a lasting impact on the South African economy, which was heavily reliant on Ukrainian wheat and other products.
