The court has heard an eight-minute recording of a call the accused received from his twin sister about two days after he and van Wyk disappeared from Connaught Estate in Elsies River. Throughout the call, the woman can be heard asking her brother if he had taken the missing child and pleading with him to share his whereabouts. She told him she couldn't leave home without being harassed as a missing persons flyer with photos of him and the deceased had been widely shared in the community. The woman held her head in her hands, cried and shook her head as the recording played aloud and the accused also appeared emotional. He could be heard telling his sister the child was not with him. The accused on Wednesday pleaded not guilty on 27 counts, some relating to other offenses.
