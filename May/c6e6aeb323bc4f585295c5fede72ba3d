CAPE TOWN - Eskom has ramped up load shedding to stage 4, saying demand for electricity is higher than anticipated, causing some units to trip. South Africa is in the grips of a cold snap with the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal experiencing snowfall. The cold weather has inevitably resulted in increased power usage. Stage 4 will kick in at 1pm on Saturday and will remain in place until 10pm when it's expected to be suspended for the day. Earlier this week, Eskom announced that stage 2 load shedding will be in place from 8am-10pm throughout the weekend. The power utility confirmed that stage 4 power cuts will be implemented until 10pm on Sunday. #Loadshedding will be increased to Stage 4 from 13:00 until 22:00 tonight. #Stage4 loadshedding will be implemented at 08:00 until 22:00 tomorrow night. Demand is higher than anticipated, some units have tripped.  This article first appeared on CapeTalk : Eskom has revised load shedding to Stage 4 following the start of a cold snap
