However, a number of serious problems we experienced currently could be the seeds of future crises. Therefore our water-related problems could have a negative impact, causing our country’s socio-economic imperatives to take a turn for the worse.” Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu said there were projects like the Mzimvubu Water Project which was aimed at providing water to 750,000 people at a cost of R25 billion.
