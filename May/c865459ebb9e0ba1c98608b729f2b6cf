As the debate around the R22 million flag rages on and continues, the Department of Arts, Sports and Culture says there is no better time than now to erect this expensive monument. Speaking to Clement Manyathela, Department of Arts and Culture deputy director-general for heritage promotion and preservation Vusithemba Ndima says it is their duty to create historical monuments. The department is receiving backlash for its plan to spend R22 million to erect a 100-metre high flag in Freedom Park in Pretoria. Many have called for Arts, Sports and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa to be sacked over this wasteful expenditure.
