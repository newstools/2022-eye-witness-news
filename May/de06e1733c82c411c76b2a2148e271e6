JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has reducing load shedding to stage 1 for several on Saturday and Sunday night. The utility said it was still short of generation capacity and so rolling power cuts will stay in place indefinitely. We'll have to endure load shedding between 5pm and 10pm. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha apologised for the inconvenience caused by the ongoing outages. Most City of Cape Town residents have been spared stage two load shedding.
