CAPE TOWN - There’s been an over 2% drop in the Western Cape’s water storage dam level. The provincial Water and Sanitation Department has urged residents to use water sparingly. The department on Tuesday said the province’s water reserves had decreased from just over 66% at present compared to 68.35% during the same time last year. The Theewaterskloof Dam is just under 68% full compared to this time last year when its water level stood at 72%. Officials, however, say this was a satisfactory outlook as more rainfall was expected over the coming winter months. The Central Karoo’s Gamka Dam has seen a remarkable recovery with water capacity there now standing at 90% up from around 50% this time last year. Meanwhile in the Eastern Cape, Nelson Mandela Bay’s combined water level now stands at 12.81%. As the metro faces 'Day Zero' with taps expected to run dry, authorities have urged residents to use water sparingly.
