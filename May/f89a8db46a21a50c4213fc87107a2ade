JOHANNESBURG - The family of former Joburg mayor, Mpho Moerane, said that while he remained unconscious and in a critical condition, he was stable. It gave an update on his condition on Wednesday morning following claims that on Tuesday night he had succumbed to his injuries from a car accident last week. Family spokesperson Mike Maile slammed both the media and so-called sources from the hospital, accusing staffers who possibly leaked the news of Moerane’s condition of being unprofessional. He said that this was a difficult time for the family. "Comrade Moerane is unconscious at the moment, however, I can't go into details of his illness. The family is distraught. I don't think that anyone is going through what the family is going through and the rumours are not making it easier for them," Maile said.
