CAPE TOWN - Suspected Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe's appeal against the outcome of his bail application has been dismissed. Mafe's defence relaunched his bail dismissal appeal at the Western Cape High Court on Monday. A full bench of the court heard the matter where his lawyer Dali Mpofu again challenged the grounds on which a lower court dismissed his bid for bail in February. Mafe was arrested on 2 January. He is the sole accused in connection with a fire that gutted Parliament’s National Assembly Building and destroyed sections of the Old Assembly Chamber.
