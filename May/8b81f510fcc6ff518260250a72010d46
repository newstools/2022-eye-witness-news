CAPE TOWN - The African Climate Reality Project has called for an urgent improvement in town planning, so it's more "climate smart and climate proof". The Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Department, the SA Weather Service, and the South African Local Government Association Wednesday  hosted a webinar on how climate change impacts society. Experts unpacked measures that are being implemented to better shield communities against severe weather events like the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal. African Climate Reality Project branch manager Amy Gillian Thorp said the country's climate change laws should also be revised to ensure it's more gender-responsive.
