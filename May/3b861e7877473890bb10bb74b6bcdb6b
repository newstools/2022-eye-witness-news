JOHANNESBURG - On Sunday evening and early Monday morning the Super Flower Blood Moon was visible in parts of the country. The May full moon is called the flower moon because it lines up with the spring flowers in the northern hemisphere and the super moon was caused by the moon being the closest to the earth in its orbit and being full. The moon briefly turned a reddish or orange colour leading up to the full lunar eclipse, which could be seen on Monday morning. Here are some pictures captured of the celestial event.
