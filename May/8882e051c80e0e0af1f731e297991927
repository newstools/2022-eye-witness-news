DURBAN - Premier Sihle Zikalala on Thursday said it would take more than a year for KwaZulu-Natal to rebuild its infrastructure that was destroyed by the recent floods. Over 435 people have been killed, many others are still missing and over 19,100 homes have been destroyed. The recent floods have left some of the province's major infrastructure such as roads  and bridges badly damaged. And while there are plans to rebuild, this will take a long time. Premier Zikalala spoke to members of the media on the sidelines on his budget speech. Community Safety MEC Peggy Nkonyeni is expected to deliver her budget vote on the approach to recovery and reconstruction soon. Our Revenue which mainly comprises revenue from commission on PERSAL deductions such as insurance premiums and garnishee orders and tender fees, is budgeted at R1.462 million. #KZNBudget2022 pic.twitter.com/WOS4sPCD3I  The purpose of the Policy and Governance programme is to initiate the province-wide development and implementation of strategies and policies to achieve a coordinated approach towards sustainable provincial growth and development.
