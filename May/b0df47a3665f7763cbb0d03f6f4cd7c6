On Monday, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula gazetted the “National Rail Policy White Paper”, a major step towards rehabilitating South Africa’s ailing railing network and services. The policy aims to position rail as the backbone of land transport in the country, according to Mbalula. Central to the reform of the network is the introduction of highspeed rail corridors.

The White Paper requires the development of a policy to hand over the commuter rail function to municipalities. Key to the policy, said Mbalula, is the enabling of investment in rail.
