JOHANNESURG - The South African Federation of Trade Unions' (Saftu) second elective conference has stalled once again after failing to move on from the issue of four suspended office bearers. Its largest affiliate is threatening to take the federation to court arguing that the four's suspensions were not lawful, and they should be allowed to participate in the conference as delegates.

This was seen as a signal of how voting for new leadership could possibly unfold. General secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has been trying to control delegates at the gathering. The four national executive committee members were suspended last month after leading a charge to have Vavi suspended.
