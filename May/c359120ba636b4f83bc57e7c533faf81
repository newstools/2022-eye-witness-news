JOHANNESBURG -  National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) members are gearing up to take to the streets on Tuesday morning - to protest - following a deadlock in wage negotiations with ArcelorMittal South Africa. The union is demanding a 10% increase across the board, housing allowance, for ArcelorMittal to contribute 80% towards employees' medical aid premiums, the scrapping of labour brokers and the insourcing of temporary workers. The steelworks company is offering a 5% increase. The union said workers have not received a meaningful increase in two years. ArcelorMittal gave employees a 2% increase last year.
