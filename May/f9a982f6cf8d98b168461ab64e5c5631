JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has now reduced load shedding to stage one on Friday night. It said generating capacity had improved but the situation may change. Stage 1 power cuts will begin at 5pm until 10pm. Eskom said  there was a possibility that the enforced power outages across the country could move to a different stage as the system remained vulnerable and unpredictable.

Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the utility suffered a loss of generation capacity overnight. “A generating unit, each at the Majuba, Tutuka, Grootvlei, Kriel and Matimba power stations were returned to service. This, however, is still insufficient to suspend the implementation of load shedding as generation units at the Kriel, Kusile, Majuba, Camden, Matla power stations either tripped or were taken offload for repairs.” #POWERALERT1Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00  22:00 tonight due to continued constraints on the power system pic.twitter.com/ccnKmpUYDZ
