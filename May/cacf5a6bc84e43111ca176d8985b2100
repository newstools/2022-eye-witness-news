CAPE TOWN - Premier Alan Winde has welcomed yet another extension of the 2022 census count. The deadline, which was meant to be Saturday, has been moved to 31 May. Only 70% of the Western Cape's population has been counted. Winde again warned service delivery in the province would suffer a major blow if this trend continued. The province stands to lose over 16% of its provincial equitable share if only 70% of residents get counted. This would shave R2.6 billion in funding off the health budget and R4.2 billion off the education budget with smaller departments also suffering losses.
