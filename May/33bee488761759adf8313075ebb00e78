CAPE TOWN - South Africa needs to drastically increase its power generation capabilities. So says Eskom's top brass. At a briefing on Wednesday on the latest round of power cuts, Chief Executive Andre de Ruyter has said power cuts shouldn't become the new normal. "We are working very closely with the DMRE  as well as the IPP office to accelerate and expedite the implementation of these projects. It is in our interest as electricity utility to make sure that we can bring this online as quickly as possible this additional capacity". Yet it has become a norm for years now. Power outages could return this evening following three consecutive days of stage two load-shedding - over peak hours in the evening. This year so far - the country's had to endure 32 days of mass electricity cuts - up from 26 days in the same period in 2021.
