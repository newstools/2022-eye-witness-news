JOHANNESBURG – Eskom on Tuesday said stage 3 load shedding will kick in from 5 pm until 10 pm as it had initially been planned. On Monday, the power utility announced stage 4 load shedding after CEO Andre de Ruyter said the power grid remained vulnerable as they struggled to bring its generating units back to service. Eskom has urged all customers to switch off all non-essential appliances to avoid a power surge when the power is restored. #Stage3 #loadshedding will take place tonight from 17:00 to 22:00.
