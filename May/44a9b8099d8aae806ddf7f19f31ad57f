JOHANNESBURG - Trade Unions in South Africa said the COVID-19 pandemic had made exploitation the new normal. Unions including Cosatu, Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union, Saftu and Numsa commemorated Worker’s Day on Sunday against the backdrop of a growing unemployment rate. Numsa said that the COVID-19 pandemic had been devastating to the global economy and to the lives of ordinary people. While some industries managed to thrive during lockdown, the gains had not been seen on a worker level. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated an already volatile and scarce job sector. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said that this led to massive restructuring and retrenchments as companies sought secure profits. "Only a united working class can succeed in resisting the power of capital. We want a permanent end to the suffering of workers and their families. We want a South Africa-based equality for all, not just a wealthy few," she said. Numsa has vowed to prioritise the fight against joblessness. It said that some trade unions had failed their members.
