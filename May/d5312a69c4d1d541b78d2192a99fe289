CAPE TOWN - Two suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman in Wolseley more than a year ago. The suspects were apprehended in Tulbagh in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Cape Union Mart executive Renee Jain's body was found at her home last March following a robbery. “Renee Jain’s body was discovered in her residence at De Vierde Liefde Nature Reserve in Wolseley after her neighbour suffered a house robbery perpetrated by her killers. The suspects fled the second crime scene in a Nissan X-Trail, which they took during the house robbery” said the Police’s Andre Traut. Her alleged killers are expected in the Wolseley Magistrates Court on Thursday on charges of murder and robbery.
